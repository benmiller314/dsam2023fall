      <h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>

<p>In addition to shared assignments, everyone in the class will be expected to work on an independent project for several hours a week <a href="#mindful-practice-journal">outside of class</a>, and to update a <a href="#iteration">public archive</a> of your progress as you go. You will <a href="#presentations-and-peer-review">present your project to the class</a> three times over the semester for generous, formative review by your professor (me) and each other.</p>

<p>These projects can vary as much as your interests do, and should incorporate tools and theories appropriate to the questions each person is asking. I’ll expect everyone to <strong><a href="/office.html">meet with me</a> before the end of week 3</strong> (in 2023, that would be by Friday, September 15th) – and ideally before the end of week 2 (September 8th) – so I can help point you in productive directions.</p>

<p>We’ll have some time in class to collectively troubleshoot your independent projects-in-progress, which will surely help everyone to learn both about a wider range of tools and about the process of finding paths forward! But you can also always ask me for follow-up advice during office hours.</p>

<h2 id="mindful-practice-journal">Mindful Practice Journal</h2>

<p><em>h/t to Alison Langmead for some of this language</em></p>

<p>There is a myth that “computers make things faster,” but this is as misleading as the idea that “practice makes perfect.” In both cases, repeating certain tasks can indeed become more automatic, but defining those tasks and refining how they’re carried out requires a great deal of time, effort, and mindfulness. In the context of interpretive disciplines, mindful work with digital computing can, in fact, take much <em>longer</em> than working in modes you’re already used to.</p>

<p><strong>You should plan to spend at least two to six hours on your project <em>each and every week</em>.</strong> Some of that time will be spent reading documentation, debugging or reformatting, searching for answers to questions about provenance of your objects of study; some will be spent in direct analysis or composing; some will be spent in preparing presentations, translating notes-to-self into a format more amenable to a wider audience. It is common, faced with this kind of “grey” work, for students to become frustrated with their research because it is hard to see how far they have progressed week by week; what’s more, the heart of their transformative learning is often not visible in the products they are producing, but is rather a transformation in mental state.</p>

<p>To keep you present in this work, and in fact to help you see all the learning you’re engaged in, I ask that you <strong>keep a daily journal of what hours you worked on your project and what you did in those hours.</strong> I will not ask you to share the journal itself with anyone, but as you will see below, you will be asked to draw on it – to interpret and present <em>what you have learned from the journaling</em> for our classroom community.</p>

<aside class="alert alert-info">NB: Because of the private, reflective nature of the mindful practice journal, I expect this will be separate from the more public commit messages you may compose for git / GitHub, if you're using it. That said, it's not a bad idea to commit frequently, e.g. at the end of working sessions in which your project's product changes, and to use these commit messages mindfully.</aside>

<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>

<p>In addition to your private accounting for time, I am asking that you periodically update <strong>a “deliverable,” public-facing version of your project</strong> that you host on the web. This will develop iteratively: whether you begin with ideas in pursuit of materials or materials in pursuit of ideas, you will most likely need to move back and forth between those poles multiple times, each time sharpening your sense of what you need or what you have. The <strong>palimpsest</strong> of these over-writing refinements will be a core component of your final portfolio for this class.
While your Mindful Practice Journal is with yourself as the audience, this web-based palimpsest is best written for an audience that includes me as well as your peers.</p>

<p>You may use any web-based publishing platform you’re comfortable with, e.g. Wix, WordPress, SquareSpace, Medium; there are many free options. One option you should be aware of, if you’re not already, is GitHub Pages, which integrates with the git version control software I’ll already be asking you to try out for tracking your changes. Perhaps the easiest path to making a public-facing website with GitHub is <a href="https://open-fuego.github.io/Open-Fuego-Coding-Tools/">Open Fuego</a>: a templating structure designed from the outset to make it easier to work with HTML, and developed right here at Pitt by Dr. Stephen Quigley (English).</p>

<h2 id="presentations-and-peer-review">Presentations and Peer Review</h2>

<p>In several designated weeks across the semester (see the <a href="schedule">course calendar</a>), you will prepare a <strong>short presentation</strong> to the class. In addition to sharing the latest iteration of your palimpsest, these presentations afford the opportunity to talk about process breakthroughs and moments of stuckness. By discussing these together, we gift each other the chance to learn about more subjects, more tools, more questions, than we would have time to engage with individually – as well as a chance for a change in perspective that might suggest a promising way forward (or, for that matter, around).</p>

<p>Toward that end, after each in-class discussion of the projects, I will ask you to prepare <strong>written comments to your peers</strong>. This act of writing will help you as a reviewer articulate what you’re noticing, what you’re wondering, and what you’re taking away; it will also ensure for the person and project under review that the conversation doesn’t simply vanish into air. At the end of the semester, I will ask you to review the notes you’ve received and cite the most helpful ones in your final reflection.</p>

<p>To prepare for your presentations, you should begin by asking yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What was I trying to do?</li>
  <li>What happened? (check in with your <a href="mindful-practice-journal">Mindful Practice Journal</a>)</li>
  <li>What questions was I able to answer, with what evidence? (Even if your “answer” is “I can not yet support or refute my hypothesis, because…”)</li>
  <li>What am I excited about?</li>
  <li>What am I wondering?</li>
</ul>

<p>This being an introductory seminar, I’m not expecting everyone to get to a complete, publishable, argument or exhibit; I <em>am</em> expecting everyone to make progress toward defensible claims and presentable artifacts. By the end of the course, you should be ready to propose a semester-long project you <em>could</em> take to completion in DSAM 3100: Practicum. Follow your curiosity, and be prepared for some frustration. As long as you can find some pleasure in the difficulty, you should be in a good spot for learning.</p>

<h2 id="final-reflection">Final Reflection</h2>

<p>Reflecting on what you learn in the process is at least as important as reaching any particular goals you set early on. The last assignment for the semester is a <strong>reflective letter to me</strong>, both articulating your learning in the class and illustrating your claims about that learning by calling attention to features of your products or your processes. The goal here is less a restatement of what you’ve already written than an opportunity to think synthetically, across iterations and into the future.</p>

<p>To help you get there, I’ll periodically ask you to take stock in writing of both your projects and our in-class discussion, linking the theories we’ve read to your independent work and vice versa.</p>

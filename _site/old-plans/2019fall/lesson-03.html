<h2 id="2-first-project-soundscape-narrative-20-min">2. First project: Soundscape Narrative (20 min)</h2>

<p>As I explained in the syllabus, your first project is to <strong>arrange layers of sound to convey a sense of place and story.</strong> In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to learn how to capture sound and edit it using digital tools, and</li>
  <li>to explore the affordances of sound as a medium,</li>
</ol>

<p>with particular attention to its ability to communicate</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>immersive environment</em> and</li>
  <li><em>narrative pacing and change</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-success">

<p>Let’s read through this together.</p>

<!--
Go through overview, constraints, deadlines. The sections below are prep for the "setup" section.
-->

<h2 id="3a-what-git-does-better-than-github">3a. What Git does better than GitHub</h2>

<p>As you’ll have learned from the videos, GitHub is a (mostly web-based) file-sharing and project-management platform built on top of Git – the version control system that runs mostly on text commands. GitHub’s pretty, well, pretty.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Let's pause for a moment: <strong>Why would we ever want to use Git outside of GitHub?</strong>
</div>

<details>
<summary>Super-technical people may have many more reasons than I want to get into. For today, let's focus on a few quick victories... </summary>


<ul>
<li>Git lets us "stage" multiple files at once and wrap them in a single commit.</li>
<li>Git lets us keep track of small changes locally before we're ready to share them with the world – and then to "push" multiple commits all at once.</li>
<li>Using the command line lets us access and activate more features of Git than the GitHub defaults allow.</li>
</ul>

These will all be important for using Audacity, which we'll demonstrate next time.
</details>

<p>All of that depends on getting your files from GitHub onto your own computer, while still keeping them linked and tracked.</p>

<p>Which means it’s now time to <strong><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/"><em>clone</em> the repository you just created</a></strong>: that is, let’s download it and make sure we’re still tracking it with the same Git commit history.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="github clone or download button" src="../assets/img/github-clone-or-download.png" title="The clone button is just above the list of files, on the right." />
</figure>

<p>There are three ways…</p>

<figure>
<img alt="github clone or download button, open" src="../assets/img/github-clone-or-download-2.png" />
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>download zip</li>
  <li>command line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone %clone_url%</code></li>
  <li>open in desktop</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-multiple-views-of-the-same-files">4. Multiple Views of the Same Files</h2>

<p>Where do the files go when you clone them? You could use Windows Explorer or Mac Finder to open the folder…</p>

<p>… but how to do commits there? How to see file history?</p>

<p>Enter the <strong>command line</strong>, a.k.a. <em>Terminal</em> on Mac, or <em>GitBash</em> (or <em>PowerShell</em>) on Windows.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Not sure how to open a command line? Try <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html">these instructions</a>.
</div>

<p>Much as a repository is just another name for a file folder you’re tracking, the command line is just another way of seeing the files you’re used to seeing in windows. (Lowercase ‘w.’)</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Change something in one view, and it changes in the other. Because it's really the same place.
</div>

<h3 id="moving-around-at-the-command-line">Moving around at the command line</h3>

<p>To get where you’re going:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>path/to/your/folder    <span class="c"># change directory</span>
<span class="nb">pwd</span>               <span class="c"># print working directory (i.e. where am I?)</span>
<span class="nb">ls</span>                <span class="c"># list directory contents</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ..             <span class="c"># go up one directory level</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~              <span class="c"># go to home folder</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To clone a remote repository (i.e. a project on GitHub): grab the URL from that download button and use it instead of the %remote_url% in this command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone %remote_url%
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(Note that you’ll then need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into the directory that creates.)</p>

<p>To see what git is tracking:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basic git workflow:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status           
git pull             <span class="c"># download changes from GitHub</span>
git status           <span class="c"># start of loop</span>
<span class="c"># here you make changes to your files</span>
git add %filename%   <span class="c"># optionally repeat</span>
git status
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"your headline commit message - note the quotes"</span> <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"your optional extra details, if you want them, just go in a second message."</span>
                     <span class="c"># repeat loop as desired</span>
git push             <span class="c"># publish your changes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- Ben quickly demos -->

<h3 id="yet-another-view">Yet another view</h3>

<p>Alternately, if you’ve downloaded <a href="GitHub Desktop">https://desktop.github.com</a>, you can use a visual interface to accomplish all of those local commands. And it’ll also generously prompt you to push changes when you’ve finished committing them.</p>

<!-- Ben quickly demos -->

<p>(NB: If you haven’t tried GH Desktop in a few years, it’s vastly improved since then.)</p>

<h2 id="3b-back-to-making-use-of-git-outside-of-github">3b. Back to making use of Git outside of GitHub</h2>

<div class="alert alert-success">
With all that settled, let's finally take advantage of Git outside of GitHub, and <strong>make two changes in the same commit:</strong>

<ol>
<li>rename the README.md file to ASSIGNMENT.md, and</li>
<li>create a new README.md file that describes, in your own words, what you think you might make in this space. (Don't worry, you can always change it later.)</li>
</ol>
Then <em>push</em> your changes so they appear on GitHub.
</div>

<p>EXT: If you’re already good with all this – e.g. if you’ve used Git before – please help others who are catching up.</p>

<h1 id="4-very-brief-intro-to-the-command-line-going-behind-the-scenes-but-the-usual-scenes">4. Very Brief Intro to the Command Line: going behind the scenes (but the usual scenes)</h1>

<p>Much as a repository is just another name for a file folder you’re tracking, the command line is just another way of seeing the files you’re used to seeing in windows. (Lowercase ‘w.’)</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Not sure how to open a command line? Try <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html">these instructions</a>.
</div>

<p>To get where you’re going:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>path/to/your/folder    <span class="c"># change directory</span>
<span class="nb">ls</span>                <span class="c"># list directory contents</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Download the folder, preserving the connected history:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone %clone_url%
</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: Don't include those percent signs; that's just my way of saying that <em>clone_url</em> is a variable, not a literal string you need to type in.
</div>

<p>Core commands you’ll need often:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status           
git pull             <span class="c"># download changes from GitHub</span>
git status           <span class="c"># start of loop</span>
git add %filename%    
git status
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"your headline commit message"</span> <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"your optional extra details, if you want them, just go in a second message."</span>
                     <span class="c"># repeat loop as desired</span>
git push             <span class="c"># publish your changes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>NB:</strong> Edits that you make outside of the command line are reflected in the command line. Why? Because <em>it's the same folder, just viewed from a different vantage point.</em>
</div>

<h2 id="5-a-little-command-line-setup-for-the-soundscape-narrative">5. A little command line setup for the Soundscape Narrative</h2>

<p>Armed with that primer, let’s do one more thing at the command line before you go out and start recording and editing soundscapes.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/soundscape-prompt#setup" class="alert-link">Head back into the assignment prompt, and scroll down to Setup.</a> Follow the instructions there.

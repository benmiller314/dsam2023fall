<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>: a draft of your group project, in pursuit of the vision in your proposal</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the Day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)</li>
  <li>Set goals for today (3-5 min)</li>
  <li>Studio time!</li>
  <li>Set deadlines</li>
  <li>Exit teaser</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-final-portfolio-introduction-10-min">1. Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)</h2>

<p>The final portfolio will consist of a single post on the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/">issue queue</a> containing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a <strong>prose reflection</strong> of at least 800-1200 words (1200-1800 recommended), reflecting on the course and framing the portfolio’s contents in terms of your learning and goals;
    <ul>
      <li>NB: I have a <strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/blob/gh-pages/uploads/handout--final-portfolio-prompt.docx?raw=true">handout</a></strong> with guidelines and prompts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>representative thumbnails, hyperlinked to final versions</strong> of your four unit projects, i.e. Soundscape Narrative, Visual Argument, Website, and Collaboration;</li>
  <li><strong>links to your repositories</strong> (on either GitHub or Box) for each of those pieces; and</li>
  <li><strong>a thumbnail of at least one specific prior draft, hyperlinked to that file in the revision history</strong>, allowing you to talk about your revision skills.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to the portfolio, or as preparation for it, I encourage you to retake the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey">Tech Comfort Survey</a> from the start of the semester. Among other things, it’ll give you a space to officially tell me whether and how I can use your work as an example in future semesters.</p>

<p>What questions do you have about all that?</p>

<!-- NB: There is no separate reflection deadline for the collaborative unit; you can just include that in the final reflection for the semester. -->

<h2 id="2-set-goals-for-today-3-5-min">2. Set goals for today (3-5 min)</h2>

<p>Leaving time for the end of class to share a teaser of your project with the full group, what’s your goal to have finished by, say, 3:30?</p>

<p>What will each of you be working on first?</p>

<p>How long do you expect it to take?</p>

<p>How often will you check in with each other?</p>

<p><strong>The Project Manager should document this somewhere.</strong></p>

<p>A reminder of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcXvQsBNPaumL6h_7ghKLJbQxPe_ALCiFMtPgaQI0Zk/edit#heading=h.kxpc4jsbvq0i">bit.ly/cdm2019fall-criteria</a>.</p>

<!-- My proposed starting points:
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
* Record somewhere the roles and/or tasks performed by each member of the group
* Document planning strategies from early notes / sketches to revised versions
* Include reflections that honestly celebrate group members’ strengths and contributions
* Collectively include more than one mode of composition (e.g. text, sound, image, code, etc)
-->

<h2 id="3-studio-time">3. Studio time!</h2>

<p>Use the time to enact your roles and move your projects forward.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as a screenshot</li>
   <li>as a git commit, saying what you've just achieved</li>
   <li>as a project file or export, whatever's most relevant</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="4-set-deadlines-5-10-min">4. Set deadlines (5-10 min)</h2>

<p>Your individual tasks will be determined within each group, so make sure you <strong>discuss your goals with each other and write them down somewhere.</strong> Are you considering this piece done, or did you have a different deadline (Sunday)? Are there stretch goals you’d still like to try for? Who’s going to work on what?</p>

<h2 id="5-think-about-revision">5. Think about revision</h2>
<p>When we get back after Thanksgiving, we’ll have just two classes. The first will be a revision-oriented studio, in which you can go back to work on any project you’d like… or to use class time to draft your final reflections.</p>

<p>The Thursday will be a celebration and sharing of your projects.</p>

<p>Which reminds me: there will be a Digital Media Symposium on Friday, December 6, from 12:30pm to 3:00pm, in CL 501. Hope to see you there!</p>

<h2 id="6-exit-note-project-teasers-5-10-min">6. Exit “note”: project teasers (5-10 min)</h2>

<p>Usually we share drafts, get feedback, all that good stuff; in this unit, because each group already contains multitudes, I thought we could get away without it. But you have been working kind of isolated from each other, so in lieu of an exit note, <strong>I’d like to ask each group to do a little oral preview of your collaborative project:</strong> just tell us what you’ve been working on! We should have time to do more in-person playing through of the sites on the last day of class.</p>

<p>aka Something / That I Remember</p>

<p><strong>Texts to have read</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paul Ford’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">“Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes”</a></li>
  <li>Your own change logs (commit histories)</li>
  <li>Lesson plans on this website</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify something said, read, or made in this course that you want to remember beyond this semester.</li>
  <li>Consider which earlier projects, if any, you’ll want to revise for the final portfolio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the Day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>OMETs (and tech comfort survey, take 2)</li>
  <li>Collaborative projects: introductions</li>
  <li>Collaborative projects: play time</li>
  <li>Gifts and Remembrances (depending on the clock)</li>
  <li>Endless departures</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="omets-or-studio-time">OMETs or studio time</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Remember that these evaluations of teaching serve multiple purposes, and go to multiple audiences:
<ul>
<li>They'll go to my program director, to help determine if I should keep teaching this course; <!-- for adjuncts, that may make the difference in whether they get renewed again at all --></li>
<li>they'll become part of my portfolio application for tenure, read by other faculty inside and outside my department; <!-- again: renewal. also: promotion --></li>
<li>and, after grades are turned in, they'll go to me, so I can use them to revise and update the course. For that purpose, I especially value the free responses. (I also added a few numerical questions that are particular to this iteration of the course.)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>So the OMETs are pretty important!</p>

<div class="alert alert-white">
If you haven't yet filled out your survey, please do so now. You should have a link to the survey on the homepage of your CourseWeb account, or in your Pitt email.

EXT: I know many of you have already filled out the survey; as an alternative (or if you're waiting for others to finish), why not head over to the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey">Tech Comfort Survey</a> and compare your answers now to the ones from January?
</div>

<p>EXT: If you’ve done both of those things to your satisfaction and you’re waiting for your classmates to finish, you can use this time for solo work on your portfolio / revisions or your final reflection.</p>

<p>I’ll leave the room for 10-15 minutes, to give you some privacy; I’ll probably go around to the tables by the elevator. Let me know if you want me to come back earlier than that.</p>

<h2 id="2-collaborative-projects-introductions">2. Collaborative projects: introductions</h2>

<p>Each group will have 5-10 minutes to share the awesome. This isn’t a workshop, but rather a celebration, and an invitation: afterward, we’ll have time to play through the games and scroll through the websites.</p>

<p>So walk us through</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>an introduction to the thing you made:
  <ul>
    <li>what's the premise?</li>
    <li>where can we access it? (can someone in the group write the URL on the board?)</li>
  </ul>  
</li>
<li>a celebration of group members' strengths and contributions<!--remember that from the criteria?-->, and</li>
<li>what the fate of the project will be for the foreseeable future:
    <ul>
        <li>will you keep it alive?</li>
        <li>can others participate if they want?</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="3-collaborative-projects-play-time">3. Collaborative projects: play time!</h2>

<h2 id="4-check-in-with-the-clock">4. Check in with the clock</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If we have less than five minutes left, we’ll skip to the poem.</li>
  <li>If we have more than ten minutes left, let’s share some thanks first.</li>
  <li>If we’re in between, let’s have a quick Q&amp;A on the final reflection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-endless-departures">5. Endless departures</h2>

<p>And other announcements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If we had a final exam, it would be <strong>this coming Tuesday,</strong> from 12:00pm-1:50pm. Instead, the <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring//uploads/handout--final-portfolio-prompt.docx">final portfolio</a> is due at the end of that exam slot: Tuesday, December 10, at 1:50pm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reflection is the main thing, so if you do make revisions, please be sure to talk about them in the reflection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ll hold extra office hours tomorrow, 12-1, as usual – and then next week on <em>Monday</em> 12-1pm (and again on Wednesday, though that’s after our official portfolio deadline of Tuesday at 1:50pm). Email me if you have questions outside those hours, and I’ll do my best to help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right after office hours tomorrow, come by the Digital Media Showcase in room 501! There will also be food and stuff from the Secret Pittsburgh course. See <a href="../uploads/showcase-flyer-2019fall.pdf">flyer</a> for details.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Work to have achieved</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources">resources page</a> and unit assignment <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2019fall#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage">goals and options</a></li>
  <li>Write a <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/8">visual rhetoric proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Guiding thoughts for Studio (5-10 min)</li>
  <li>Studio time (50-55 min)</li>
  <li>Homework reminder (5 min)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-guiding-thoughts-for-studio-5-10-min">1. Guiding thoughts for Studio (5-10 min)</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">Thompson</a>, you can reliably convey three levels of dominance; after that, it starts to get mushy.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take a few minutes to write, with your own proposed visual argument / rhetorical collage in mind:
<ul>
<li>What options do you have for putting in your top three? What's next in line?</li>
<li>How would the layout need to change if you changed your ranking?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="gimp-notes">GIMP Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remember our strategies for creating hierarchy: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcXvQsBNPaumL6h_7ghKLJbQxPe_ALCiFMtPgaQI0Zk/edit#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8">bit.ly/cdm2019fall</a> (see the section on “Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric”).</li>
  <li>GIMP’s toolbox is kinda cluttered, but the tools are also indexed by category in the menu bar, helpfully, under Tools. (And every tool has a keyboard shortcut, too: may be worth memorizing your go-to devices.)</li>
  <li>There’s often extra tips for the tool you’re using in a tiny font, under the editing window.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="timing-reminder--hw-preview">Timing Reminder / HW Preview</h3>
<p>Some preview of the project will be due before next class, just to make sure you’re all getting started on it.</p>

<p>Therefore, the rest of today’s class is all about working on your individual projects! <strong>Find source images or text, level up on layering, watch relevant tutorials on effects or on layout, and see what happens when you apply them to your own digital canvas.</strong></p>

<p>I know your lives are busy; take advantage of this dedicated time free from other distractions and obligations to move your piece forward. At the same time, it’s worth noting that you’re working <em>in a shared space</em>, in a studio. If you have questions, or you want feedback on something, you have your classmates and your instructor on-hand. Try not to monopolize anyone’s time, but do be open to the possibility of getting farther together than you could on your own.</p>

<h2 id="2-okay-now-go-to">2. Okay, now go to!</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Do whatever work you need to get *something* toward your project posted to your GitHub repository by Thursday. The goal for now is to get a feel for how you work with GIMP, not to have a finished product.
</div>

<p>On Thursday, we’ll use that experience to refine our shared baseline criteria and brainstorm some aspirational goals.</p>

<p>Call me over if you need help with GIMP or Git/GitHub!</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Important: <strong>Save your files as you go!</strong>
</div>

<div style="height:50px; height:10vh;">
<!-- This div left intentionally blank, for spacing -->
</div>

<h2 id="3-quick-report-back">3. Quick report back</h2>

<p>Just as a way for me to check in, I’d like to hear more about what happened today: did you find images? Level up on a particular GIMP skill? Decide something about your project? Raise a question in a new way that you’d like some help with?</p>

<p>Send me a quick email, or say out loud to share with the whole class.</p>

<h1 id="4-homework-for-next-time">4. Homework for next time</h1>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Compose a <strong>Visual Argument Preview</strong>: an early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning, to get practice with GIMP, and to start testing out the ideas from your proposal (or beyond).
</div>

<p>Please turn in:</p>
<ul>
<li> A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.xcf)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and text so far (need not be a complete argument or collage yet).</li>
<li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts). If you can capture a moment of success or stuckness, all the better.</li>
<li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li>
<li> An updated <strong>ASSETS.md</strong> file, now with the files you're actually obtained. As you go, add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165). <ul><li>If you prefer, you can create a new CREDITS.md file for this, preserving the ASSETS list for things you're still seeking.</li></ul></li>
<li><em>Optional, but encouraged:</em> An <strong>exported .png file</strong>. Just like Audacity, GIMP's default save mode is a complex / modular "project file," of type .xcf; should the project fail to load, it would be great to have a simple image file as a backup. We won't be able to see how you achieved your layout, but we will be able to see the image. _Important bonus:_ you'll also be able to use GitHub history to compare one version to another, side by side. Pretty cool, right?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where to turn in?</strong> Ideally, to GitHub; if that’s not working for you yet, post to Box (and put a link to the Box folder in the GitHub README.md file).</p>

<p><strong>Work to have achieved</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read about graphic design principles (<a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive &amp; negative space</a>, <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance &amp; hierarchy</a>, <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm &amp; movement</a>)</li>
  <li>Find a graphic or visual design that makes a claim or argument</li>
  <li>Analyze the designed artifact through the lenses of graphic design principles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Building our vocabulary (20 min) <!-- was 30 last time, let's see if that continues online or not --></li>
  <li>Loop writing into offline sketching (15 + 10 min)</li>
  <li>GIMP Practice and concurrent GIMP Demo (20-25 min)</li>
  <li>Homework for next time</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-building-our-vocabulary-10-15-min">1. Building our vocabulary (10-15 min)</h2>

<p>We have a bunch of new terms! Let’s try to annotate these – just a few key words each - so we know we’re on the same page. Head on over to <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2022spring-notes">bit.ly/cdm2022spring-notes</a>, under “Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric.” I’ll open up the breakout rooms so you can discuss.</p>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: To get credit for asynchronous participation, use the comments feature in the doc to add at least two links to additional examples that illustrate the principles of visual dominance/hierarchy, rhythm, or negative space.
</div> -->

<ul>
  <li>Visual Dominance/Hierarchy <!-- What draws the eye? -->
    <ul>
      <li>Scale <!-- big --></li>
      <li>Value <!-- dark/intense --></li>
      <li>Color <!-- contrast --></li>
      <li>Style <!-- contrast --></li>
      <li>Proximity <!-- isolation --></li>
      <li>Density <!-- contrast --></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Visual Rhythm <!-- What's it for? -->
    <ul>
      <li>Repetition <!-- establish unity --></li>
      <li>Pattern <!-- establish backdrop for contrast --></li>
      <li>Flow <!-- suggest viewing sequence; works through variation set against similarities / multiple kinds of dominance, use of line --></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Positive and negative space <!-- breathing room, surprises --></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ext-using-our-vocabulary-5-10-min">EXT: Using our vocabulary (5-10 min)</h3>
<p>If your group feels finished and others are still working, share the images you posted to the forum within your group. See if you can level up on your comfort analyzing visual design, using the terms from the reading (and now google doc).</p>

<!--
## EXT: Clear hierarchy vs. flat hierarchy
If we all finish filling out the google doc with time to spare (by 3:05, say), I'd like to look at two examples that came in on the forum.

<h2 id="2a-loop-writing-15-min-">2a. Loop writing (15 min) <!-- Takes 15 min --></h2>
<p>For this generative exercise, adapted from <a href="http://bit.ly/perlfeltsense">one by Sondra Perl</a>, you’ll need somewhere to write and somewhere to <em>draw</em>. Printer paper would be great; a notebook is also okay; the computer’s probably not. I like pencil, but your preference may vary.</p>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>If you need to take a minute to get those supplies, please do so now.</strong></p>

<p>If you're waiting for everyone else to come back, see if you can close your eyes and listen to your breath. (If this kind of body attention makes you uncomfortable, though, don't do it. Just have patience, and try not to judge.) Think about how you're sitting: where you're supported. Try to alleviate any tension.</p>
</div> -->

<p>Take a few minutes to think in writing about the visual arguments you might want to make. I’ll read a series of questions aloud. Repeat them silently to yourself, and when you feel yourself answering, make a list.</p>

<p>These lists will remain private, unless you choose to share. I won’t ask for them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What ideas do you want help remembering?</li>
  <li>Or what do you want to persuade others of?</li>
  <li>Is there something you’ve noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others?</li>
  <li>Is there anything else you’d like to add? Something from a course? From an activity or group you participate in? Something you’ve been reading about? (If there’s an idea you thought of working on before class, be sure to add it now.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Take a moment now to read back over your lists. Is there something that stands out, that says, <em>me, pick me</em>? Choose one thing to work with, at least for today, and mark it in some way. Then copy it into a clean page.</p>

<p>With that chosen subject, write again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What terms or images come to mind when you think of this subject? … Think about categories of words: actions vs things. Descriptors.</li>
  <li>Is there anything you’re forgetting to add to your list? A line from a song? A color?</li>
  <li>Who else might be interested in this? Who, that is, could be your audience?</li>
</ol>

<p>See if you can summon up the whole of this idea, like it’s right here in the room with you. Where does it live? Is it above you? Inside you? In the palm of your hand? Just sit with your idea for a moment, feeling where you connect to it.</p>

<h2 id="2b-offline-sketching-10-min">2b. Offline sketching (10 min)</h2>
<p>And now, draw. Take a piece of paper, fold it in quarters, and in each quarter sketch out some possibility, some version, of what your idea might look like.</p>

<p>If you can, try to make each image significantly different from each other, to give you options; you can use your lists for inspiration. If you can’t think of very different ones, then work to make just <em>some</em> change.</p>

<p>We’ll work here for a while.</p>

<h2 id="3-gimp-practice-and-concurrent-demo-20-min">3. GIMP Practice and concurrent demo (20 min)</h2>

<p>I want to give you another chance to practice with GIMP. For those who aren’t sure where to start, you can follow along with me as I do some noodling around!</p>

<p>I’m going to focus on a fairly common task, extracting a foreground object from its background, so you can move it (sometimes to an entirely new background). If we have time, we can also work on filling in the empty space the extracted object left behind.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you haven't yet changed anything in your README file, you may want to pull from my upstream branch to get a few files I added since Tuesday, including an update to the git-lfs setup and some backgrounds to play with today.
</div>

<p>Here’s what I’m using, and you can find it already in your repo (under “in-class exercise”):</p>

<p>A few options to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scissors select (edge detection)</li>
  <li>Select <em>background</em> and Invert Selection</li>
  <li>Fuzzy select (“magic wand”: contiguous pixels by color similarities)</li>
  <li>Additive/subtractive selection with shape tools (rectangle, ellipse) and Free select (lasso)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have our selection, we can…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy and paste to create a new layer</li>
  <li>File &gt; Open as Layers</li>
</ul>

<!--
1. Image > Canvas Size (use %)
2. Scissor tool
3. Copy + Paste -> Floating layer -> anchor as new
4. Scale layer
5. Scissor tool (again)
6. Invert selection, new layer again
7. Layer to image size
8. Select vertical rectangle; feather edges
9. Copy + Paste as pattern
-->

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time:</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> the unit-assignment <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2023spring#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage">goals and options</a> for the rhetorical collage / visual argument, including the Parachute Prompts if you’re not sure what to propose.</li>
  <li><strong>Write</strong> a project proposal, thinking in words about what you’d like to make:
    <ul>
      <li>What idea or argument will you try to represent? What <em>claim</em> will you try to make – or, at least, what is the triggering idea (starting point) of that claim?</li>
      <li>Include or link to a <strong>prospective assets list</strong>, i.e. a table of the images you think you’ll need and where you might be able to source them. You can choose to include that assets list in the proposal or place it as a file in your repository, to more easily track changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Link to your project repository,</strong> so it’s easier to find when we get to group work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Post</strong> your proposal to the appropriate forum on the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/">Issue Queue</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Skim</strong> the visual media <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources">resources</a> on the course site, and <strong>read/watch</strong> more deeply in anything that seems like it would help you, whether <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources#visual">advice</a> or <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources#visuals">material to work with</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>In particular, I highly recommend the LinkedIn Learning series of videos on “GIMP Essential Training.” I’ve been using GIMP for years, and I confess I learned some things even from the basic tool options videos. The whole series is about 5 hours of material, but I’m not asking you to watch the whole thing in one go! Instead, <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources#lil-gimp">I’ve marked some highlights and starting points</a>: please at least view at those, which total around 45 minutes runtime.</li>
      <li>Note that there are exercise files, should you want to follow along and make sure it works in practice.</li>
      <li>If you have trouble accessing LinkedIn Learning from my links on the Resources page, try <a href="https://my.pitt.edu/launch-task/all/cssd-linkedinlearning?terms=linkedin&amp;roles=">this LIL link instead, which routes through MyPitt</a>; you should have to log in with Pitt Passport once, but then all those direct links should just work! (Fingers crossed.) I am also happy to troubleshoot with you during office hours.</li>

# Consolidation Unit Pitch Market and Studio

**Work to have done**: Submit final-for-now website, with source files, and [reflection]({{site.github.issues_url}}); read Paul Ford [on the pleasures of reading git commit histories](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html); begin preparing for your final portfolio and a consolidation project to include in it

**Plan for the day**:

1. Review, respond, recruit
2. Tasks and roles
3. Studio time

## Review and respond

Now that you've spent some time discovering your thoughts for yourself over the weekend, it's time to share with others – and, possibly, to recruit or join up with some like-minded co-travelers.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Head into the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.leh3pxuj6n6n">shared google doc</a> and <strong>read through the project brainstorms</strong>.</p>
<p>Add polite clarifying questions using the Comments feature – or offer your services, if you'd like to form a team!</p>
</div>

We'll spend a while looping around and back in the margins or aloud.

When we're reaching a stable point, I'll ask you to record your team memberships (including solo teams) also in the google doc.


## Planning: tasks and roles

With your team (which may have one member, or more), get to planning. You'll need to have...

1. a brief **overview** of your baseline project goals, which may be revised from an initial pitch
2. a list of smaller **tasks** you'll need to accomplish to achieve those goals
3. proposed **roles** for each of your team members, if you have a team of two or more
  - [last class](lesson-24#roles-and-reflection-15-min) I'd floated these possibilities: project manager, visual designer, experience designer, programmer, researcher, copy writer. Feel free to start there or adjust as needed.
  - You may also decide it would help to read through [this excerpt from _Writer/Designer_](https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye), on ways to facilitate group collaboration.
4. a **link** to some space where you'll develop the project: most likely an existing GitHub repository or a new one.

Optionally, you can add
5. more aspirational stretch goals beyond those above.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Please <strong>post these plans to the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.8w2at2aech19">google doc</a> by the end of today's class.</strong></p>
<p>Please use the section below the names so I can more easily scoop up the group memberships for Thursday's Zoom rooms. I also recommend posting a copy of your plan in your project's README – but don't forget to post that link where I can find it!</p>
</div>


## Studio time

When you're ready to move on, I'll get out of your way. :¬)

### Set goals for today

As is our custom, please write down your  goals for in-class time at the beginning of your work session, and expect to come back at the end with an update.

I'll float around, as usual.


### Remember your resources

Don't forget that there are some pre-compiled [ Resources](../resources) that might be useful...

And please let me know if you find any more to share!

### Exit note

Five minutes before the end of class, please loop back to the google doc and make an updated plan: what do you want to have finished before Thursday?


## Homework for next time

* **Continue** with whatever work you set out for yourself to consolidate, integrate, and ideally deepen your learning this semester.
* Post a **preview** – a beginning – to the repo you linked to in today's class.
  - If you're revising, post at least one new commit.
  - I'm going by project, not person, so teams should divide the labor appropriately... and hold each other to the agreements you've made.

* EXT: If you haven't yet done so, and you have more time now than over the weekend, please do the Ford reading and commit history activity from [last class](lesson-24#homework-for-next-time)
* Have you also considered reading back through your studio goals in [the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course-slugterm}}-notes)?

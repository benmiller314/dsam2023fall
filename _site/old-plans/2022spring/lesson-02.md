# Interfaces and Repositories

<!--  BEN: Set up Zoom breakout groups ahead of time! DONE -->


**Texts to have read:**

* The [syllabus](/{{site.course.base_url}}uploads) and [related modules]({{site.course.canvas_url}}/modules)

**Work to have achieved:**

* Respond to the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm2021survey)
* Post to the main course [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/1), introducing yourself to classmates (and whoever stumbles upon it)
* Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) and [Atom](https://atom.io) (or your syntax-ready editor of choice)


## Plan for the Day

<div class="alert alert-warning">
We've had a request to record today's session. Is everyone okay with that?
</div>

1. GitHub, part 2 (~15-20 min)
  * what is a repository?
  * a demo of diffs<!-- repo, commit, history, diff -->
2. Multiple views of the same files: web, Finder/Explorer, GH Desktop
3. One more view: Atom interface <!-- Ben demo; what's made easy? -->
4. Shareback (~15 min)
5. HW Preview

Welcome back! I really enjoyed reading all the introductory posts and letters; thank you for those. If you haven't had a chance to get to know your classmates' opening posts, I encourage you to [check them out]({{site.github.issues_url}}/1)!



## 1. GitHub, part 2
In those intro posts, we saw that GitHub can host a discussion forum, so in that sense it's a community website: it makes media social.

But its core functionality is meant to solve a different media problem: tracking changes to files over time.

Renaming ever more files isn't only messy to keep track of: it also eats up your storage space, especially if you're working with multimedia. What *git* allows you to do instead is to **track the differences** between versions of files with the *same filename.*


<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's check out the GitHub.com web interface, and see how it works:
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo">https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo</a></strong>
</div>

### Initial questions to ask of any app:

- How is the space laid out?
- What's given the most prominent visual focus? Secondary focus?
- What features/tools do you have quick access to?

<!--
1. Create a new .txt file based on https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say
2. <del>Demo the importance of the extension by previewing what happens if it's .md?</del> NAH
3. Commit the new file directly to master.
    - Note that the commit message has two parts: a short label, and a bigger box. These are kind of like the subject line of an email and the email body. The first is what you'll see automatically when browsing the history; the second will require an additional click. And GitHub will let you leave the "body" blank, but you're required to have a "subject line."
4. Change the text. *Ask for suggestions in the Zoom chat.*
5. Create a new branch, then merge it. Why, you ask?
   It matters when you're working with others: you want to make sure you're comparing against the most up-to-date version, so you don't accidentally erase something new.
   This will become important in a minute.

## 2. Your turn

Time to take these abstractions and put them into practice, using our key terms to help us see differently.

We'll be working in groups. I've used your Tech Comfort Survey responses from Lesson 1 to build breakout rooms where at least one person has prior GitHub experience, so I hope you'll be able to help each other where needed!

<div class="alert alert-success">
Head to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-gh-practice#readme">https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-gh-practice</a></strong>, where you'll find more instructions for what to do next â€“ starting with forking the repo. (Thanks, group GitHub anchors!)

Start by skimming through the instructions in the README file, so you know where this is headed. (It'll spare you confusion later.) I'll give you the overview while we're still together:
<ol><li>Make a copy of the repository for your group</li>
<li>Write a story, one line per person, committing every time</li>
<li>File a <em>pull request</em> to merge it back to my repo</li></ol>
</div>

Read through the details, then follow the steps. **We'll work in Breakout Rooms for about 10-15 minutes, then report back.** Don't forget that you can use Zoom chat and screenshare to show your groupmates what you're doing.

Call me if you need me! Otherwise, I'll be floating from group to group.

## HW for next time:

* Please **read / play** through Tyler Su's ["Playing Lev Manovich"](https://tylersu.github.io/o/), which defines and illustrates five principles of new media. Be ready to talk about what you noticed, and what you wondered.
* **Listen** to the following recordings:
<!-- update each time with examples from this class where possible -->
  - Barner, Tyller. "Coffee Shop Conversations." *Digital Media and Pedagogy Showcase Spring 2019.* [http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/248](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/248).
  - Joo, Jackie. "Come Over for Dinner." *Composing Digital Media Spring 2021.* (The showcase became... complicated.) [access via GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackie216/soundscape2021spring/blob/master/Come-Over-For-Dinner-final.mp3?raw=true); description in the [repo README](https://github.com/jackie216/soundscape2021spring/blob/master/README.md)
  - Quaid, Fatema. "A Haunted Halt." *Digital Media and Pedagogy Showcase Fall 2019.* [http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/295](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/295).
  - Wick, Thomas. "Soundscape - Expedition to Planets Unknown." *Digital Media and Pedagogy Showcase Spring 2018.* [http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/178](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/178). (NB: starts loud; turn volume down)

* **Write** a short blog post to the appropriate thread [on the issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}): What do you notice, i.e. what stands out while reading or listening? What does that suggest, or what does it make you wonder?

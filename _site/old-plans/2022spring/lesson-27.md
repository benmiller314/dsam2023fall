# Consolidation Unit Studio / Planning the last class

**Work to have done**: <!-- respond to an updated version of the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey); -->Continue forward toward your consolidation unit project, based on [your task list from last time](bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.xm8afv7cdvkx).

**Plan for the day**:

1. Plan for final class
2. Studio (45-60 min)
3. HW: Carry On! + Tech Survey Redux


## Plan for final class (in two days!!)

My first agenda item for the day is to talk about our next class, because it's our last real class meeting!

One order of business to expect: I plan to set aside some in-class time for surveys. If you've already done them by then, you can use that as studio time.

But beyond that, I always like to have a chance to celebrate together and share the awesomeness you've all been able to achieve. So I'd like to invite everyone to share one thing, for 2-3 minutes each. That said, I also know time is short, and some people may prefer to have more focused work-time.

Let's take a quick straw poll [in the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes): write down the letter corresponding to what you would prefer to do:

* W - work time (studio)
* A - share the awesomeness

Instant bar graph!



## Studio
This is where I expect we'll spend the bulk of today's time. As usual, please...

1. Write your goals [in the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes)
2. Save five minutes at the end to leave an exit note to report on progress and re-set goals for moving forward.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as project files</li>
   <li>as git commits, saying what you've just achieved</li>
   <li>as mid-process screenshots</li>
   <li>as "flat" exports, if appropriate</li>
 </ul>
</div>


<!-- To accommodate the Zoom format, I've created some free-access breakout rooms for finding each other, which you *should* be able to move freely among. I'll hang out in the main room unless people need one-on-one time (when we can go to an extra room set aside for that purpose). -->

<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning">
As usual, to get credit for asynchronous participation, please add your intentions and exit notes to the google doc when you start and stop working – and aim to work for at least two 20-minute pomodoros.
</div> -->


## For next time

* Please take the [Tech Comfort Survey Redux](http://bit.ly/tech-comfort-redux), which revisits the survey from way back in the beginning of the semester. How have your comfort levels changed?
  - I've added a new question, which is important for providing examples: do you give me permission to share your projects for future teaching?
  - There's an optional free response space at the end; if you're willing to let me share some but not all your projects, please let me know.
* Set yourself some deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the Thursday?   
  - Will you continue beyond that for Sunday, knowing the final portfolio is due soon (on or before Thursday 4/28 at 2pm)?
* Document your progress as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push.
* Pending the results of the straw poll above, choose something that sticks with you from the course to share with the rest of the class: perhaps something you made and are proud of, perhaps something made or said by someone else that stuck with you – to share briefly with the rest of the class.

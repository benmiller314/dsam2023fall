<h2 id="1-creative-writing-as-a-tool-for-critical-thinking-15-20-min">1. Creative writing as a tool for critical thinking (15-20 min)</h2>

<p>Congratulations on reaching the end of the web unit! I know some of you have requested extensions, or are planning on continuing to revise as we move into our last two weeks of class, but many of you have already finished, and I’ve been enjoying the reflections as they’ve come in so far.</p>

<p>Wherever you are in terms of finalizing, I’d like you to take a few minutes to think about <em>the process</em> of composing this way, and of <em>learning</em> to compose this way. And I’d like you to get loose and have a little fun with that thinking, so I’ll ask you to use <strong>metaphor</strong> (or, more specifically, simile): to read your learning, or your composing, as something else entirely.</p>

<p>To wit:</p>

<h3 id="generate-comparisons-3-5-min">Generate comparisons (3-5 min)</h3>
<div class="alert alert-success">
   <ol class="spaced">
      <li><strong>What was it <em>like</em> to compose a website?</strong> To what other activities might you compare it? <ul class="spaced"><li>For example, was it like getting butterflies to fly in formation? (That metaphor is <a href="https://www.maps.mla.org/bulletin/article/ade.134.57">Betsy Sargent's</a>, I can't take credit for it.) Was it like writing on loose paper with a pen that's chained in a dark room? Like singing and humming at the same time?</li></ul> Let your mind wander for a minute, and see what comes to mind when you start off thinking about <em>the process of working with html, css, etc.</em></li>
      <li>Would you use the same metaphor for the other kinds of digital composing you've used this semester? If not, what other metaphor would you propose?</li>
   </ol>
</div>

<p>Take 3-5 minutes to think in writing through the questions above.</p>

<h3 id="use-comparisons-as-leverage-5-10-min">Use comparisons as leverage (5-10 min)</h3>

<p>Now I’m going to ask you to <strong>share in your small groups, working to answer a third question:</strong></p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<ol start="3"><li><em>Within the metaphors</em> you've come up with, what strategies would help you continue improving? What strategies might that suggest in real life, i.e. outside of the metaphor?</li></ol>
</div>

<p>I won’t collect this, but I will ask for some volunteers to share in a few minutes… and I suggest that you return to these when writing your end-of-semester reflection, so take notes.</p>

<p>EXT: If you’re waiting for the rest of us, consider: what personal skillsets do you feel like you now possess, that you might offer to a team of digital media composers?</p>

<h3 id="share-and-enjoy-5-10-min">Share and enjoy (5-10 min)</h3>

<p>Any volunteers? Any insights? Any questions?</p>

<p>We can take notes in the shared google doc: <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes#heading=h.4z263w5yygd9">bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes</a></p>

<h2 id="2-final-portfolio-preview-and-consolidation-unit-goals-10-15-min">2. Final Portfolio Preview and Consolidation Unit Goals (10-15 min)</h2>

<p>The final portfolio for the course is due in just three weeks (¡…!), on Thursday, April 28. (That’s our exam slot, which nominally runs from 2pm-3:50pm.)</p>

<h3 id="portfolio-contents">Portfolio contents</h3>

<p>As we have for each individual unit, for the final portfolio I’m asking you to write reflectively about the course and your work in it, crystalizing what you’ve learned – and how you will go on learning – about composing digital media.</p>

<div class="alert alert-white">
The final portfolio itself will consist of a single post on the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">issue queue</a> (thread coming soon), containing:

<ul>
  <li>a <strong>prose reflection</strong> of at least 800-1200 words (1200-1800 recommended), reflecting on the course and framing the portfolio’s contents in terms of your learning and goals;</li>
  <li><strong>representative thumbnails, hyperlinked to final rendered versions</strong> of your four unit projects, i.e. Soundscape Narrative (.mp3), Visual Argument (.png), Website (live url or index.html), and Consolidation (tbd);</li>
  <li><strong>links to your repositories</strong> (on GitHub) for each of those pieces; and</li>
  <li><strong>a thumbnail image of at least one specific prior draft</strong>, hyperlinked to that draft's commit in the revision history, allowing you to talk about your revision skills.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>As with previous reflections, I encourage you to include these screenshots and thumbnails wherever they make the most sense, rather than feeling like they need to be segregated from the rest of your thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="consolidation--integration-unit">Consolidation / integration unit</h3>

<p>Rather than draw out your reflection for as long as possible, I’m hoping you’ll be able to use these last two weeks to help digest and apply what you’ve learned over the last 12 weeks. As I put it in the <a href="../schedule">schedule</a>,</p>

<blockquote>In this final unit I’ll ask you to build on what you’ve already made: <strong>a revision, an extension, or a combination,</strong> of the modes and media you used in earlier units.</blockquote>

<p>The unit goals, then, are:
<!-- 1. to practice managing a complex project involving multiple team members --></p>
<ol>
  <li>to integrate and consolidate the skills you’ve practiced across the semester</li>
  <li>to assess your own skills as a digital media composer, to find ways <em>you</em> in particular might best contribute to a collaborative digital project (perhaps in the future)</li>
</ol>

<p>Above all, <strong>the point is to <em>get more practice.</em></strong> I don’t believe that “practice makes perfect” – perfection is not for this world – but I do believe that practice makes habitual, more automatic, less labored. Practice builds muscle memory. It frees up your mind for the next thing.</p>

<p><em>That’s</em> what I mean when I say “integration.” You don’t have to incorporate all the modes into your final project; you just have to decide what you want more practice in. And then you have to put the practice in. Make sense?</p>

<!-- At this point, here's what I wanted for the required collaboration:
## 3. Brainstorming / self-assessment (5-10 min)

First, I'd like you to think about goal two, above.
## 4. Marketplace of ideas (forming groups)
I don't have a particular strategy for group formation today, other than to let you sort it out!

That said, you should have between 2 and 4 people per group.

You don't have to have every role above represented, but it would probably be good to diversify your skillset where possible.


5. Group proposal in writing, with goals and roles
Download the file ["group-proposal.md"](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/blob/gh-pages/uploads/group-proposal.md): from that link, you can right-click the "Raw" button and Save Link As.

Then, working as a group, follow the instructions in the file.

You may also want to look at [this excerpt from _Writer/Designer_](https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye), on ways to facilitate group collaboration.


THANKS FOR NOTHING, COVID-19!

<h3 id="what-might-that-look-like">What might that look like?</h3>

<p>On the most straightforward level, this could literally be a <strong>revision of one of your existing projects.</strong> Were there stretch goals or aspirations that you think you didn’t quite figure out how to achieve? Did you write in a reflection about what you might do with more time? Well, now you have a little more time! We might call this a baseline option for this unit, though of course excellent work is still worth rewarding.</p>

<p>Another, more ambitious option would be to make a <strong><em>second</em> project in the vein of one you’ve already done</strong>: another sound-editing project, another visual argument, another website. You’ll have less time than you did originally, but you should also be higher on the learning curve. In this same vein, you could try an alternate program for the same genres: e.g. AdobeSuite parallels like Audition (for Audacity) and Photoshop (for GIMP) – or vice versa, if you started with Adobe. See what happens when you dive in again, and reflect on the differences!</p>

<p>A third, also aspirational, option is to build a <strong>new project that builds on what you know to make something different</strong>: e.g. you could try or next-level tools like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa6a7oz7vEE">Inkscape</a> for vector graphics (the Adobe parallel is Illustrator) or Ableton for music mixing (there’s a <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/">free trial</a>); or try for one of the ideas you’d already <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22paying+forward%22">proposed on the Issue Queue</a>, like 2D animation (maybe with <a href="https://www.synfig.org/">Synfig</a>), a short audio documentary, an interview-based podcast, a narrative with audio and image (you might look into Twine<a id="ftnref1" href="#ftn1" class="ftnref">[1]</a>), etc – any of which might be a collaboration that represents all its members.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Note that while I'm not requiring you to work in groups, I'm not requiring you to work solo: if you have a team that can collaborate effectively (it will help to have clear roles to play), you're welcome to go for it!</p>
<!--
<p>If you are thinking of going the group route, let me know, so I can give advice re: team roles and workflows for shared repositories. (You may also want to read <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye">this excerpt from <em>Writer/Designer</em></a>, on more general strategies for communication for cooperation during collaboration. Some good information there!)</p> -->
</div>

<h2 id="generative-writing-what-skills-to-practice">Generative writing: what skills to practice?</h2>
<!-- <div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>A proposal / plan for your consolidation unit is due by the end of Tuesday's class.</strong> If you're working in a group, one proposal per group is fine (but do say who the group members are... and, ideally, how you'd like to divide up the work.) See below for some questions to think through.</p>

<p>That said, if you're still finalizing your website, you can use this time to do that work – and to ask questions, while I'm available to help.</p>
</div>

Use the [shared google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.f0sh5csl9d1b) to state your goals for the working session, and come back to add an exit note at 4:00, as usual.

### Generative writing -->

<p><em>(This exercise adapted from Sondra Perl’s <a href="http://bit.ly/perlfeltsense">Guidelines for Composing</a>)</em>  <!-- Record this in Audacity?? --></p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">

</div>

<p>Take a breath. Close your eyes. Put down your pen, or take your hands off your keyboard. Find a way to be present to yourself, wherever you are, and know that <strong>whatever you write for the next set of questions will not be collected:</strong> it’s for you alone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start by making a list: What’s on my mind? what have I been meaning to do lately? When you feel yourself answering, begin to write.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set that list aside – it’ll wait for you until you’ve finished here – and ask yourself again: What skills have I been building in this class? What do I feel I’ve leveled up on, or that I’m on the verge of leveling up on? What am I on the edge of accomplishing? As before, just make a list, like an inventory: don’t delve too much into any one item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now ask yourself: Is there anything I’ve been trying to do in this class, but haven’t yet done? Any aspirational goals I meant to achieve, but just ran out of time for? Did any of the ideas above sound both fun and achievable, a way to make these last couple of weeks more celebratory than stressful? Again, take a quick survey; you’ll have time later to expand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take one more moment to consider: Is there anything I’m forgetting, that could go on this list? If you came to this exercise with a project already in mind, make sure to add that to your list.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Take a moment now to read back over your lists. Is there something that stands out, that says, <em>me, pick me</em>? Choose one thing to work with, at least for today, and mark it in some way. Then copy it into a clean page.</p>

<p>With that chosen subject, write again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What terms or images come to mind when you think of this subject? … Think about categories of words: actions vs things. Descriptors (adjectives).</li>
  <li>Is there anything you’re forgetting to add to your list? A line from a song? A color?</li>
  <li>Who else might be interested in this? Who, that is, could be your audience?</li>
</ol>

<p>See if you can summon up the whole of this idea, like it’s right here in the room with you. Where does it live? Is it above you? Inside you? In the palm of your hand? Just sit with your idea for a moment, feeling where you connect to it. You can return to this feeling of connection later, as a guide to what’s most essential, and what’s most exciting.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>Take a few moments to jot down any notes that will help you retain this sense of possibility:</strong> a sketch or two? a title or a tagline? a characteristic sound? a cast of characters?</div>

<h2 id="roles-and-reflection-15-min">Roles and Reflection (15 min)</h2>

<p>The core goals of the unit are, again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to integrate and consolidate the skills you’ve practiced across the semester</li>
  <li>to assess your own skills as a digital media composer, to find ways <em>you</em> in particular might best contribute to a collaborative digital project (perhaps in the future)</li>
</ol>

<p>That first generative loop writing took you through the skills and projects you might engage with, i.e. that first unit goal; now I want to spend some time thinking about the second.</p>

<p>Consider the following roles:</p>

<table class="table table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr><th scope="col">role</th><th scope="col">description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>project manager</td><td>organize schedule, keep everyone on task</td></tr>
    <tr><td>visual designer</td><td>plan layout and execute visual hierarchy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>experience designer</td><td>plan interactivity, spatiality, sequence</td></tr>
    <tr><td>programmer</td><td>get into the weeds of code</td></tr>
    <tr><td>researcher</td><td>find materials and assets, quickly grasp tutorials</td></tr>
    <tr><td>copy writer</td><td>produce public-ready prose</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take some notes:
<ul><li>Where do you see your strengths, within these categories?</li>
<li>Where are you on the cusp of leveling up?</li>
<li>Where would you like more help from a teammate?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="ext-studio">EXT: Studio</h2>

<p>As time allows, you can either get started on revisions (including website finalizing) or start thinking more concretely about another project you might start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the parts of the project?</li>
  <li>What assets will you need to find?</li>
  <li>What do you already know how to do, and what will you need to learn (or outsource to someone who already knows)?</li>
  <li>Would some tasks be easier to delegate to or split with a partner?</li>
  <li>You don’t have to write this one down publicly, but consider it on your own: if you answered yes to the last question, who might you ask to partner with you?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If we run out of time for these questions, work on it for homework</strong>; we’ll start next class with project pitches, and have a marketplace of ideas to see if we have some natural groups starting to form.</p>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-success">
If you'd like me to set up breakout rooms to talk as a group, let me know! I'm happy to do so.
</div> -->

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>If you haven't yet finished your website project and reflection, start there.</strong> You could even save the Ford reading for afterward, in that case, as it's mainly intended to set up your final reflection (on the whole course), with project inspiration as a side benefit.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><em>Preparing for the final portfolio:</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read</strong> Paul Ford’s short “Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes” from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019).

      <li>Ford writes, “I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>” <strong>Read back</strong> through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans; maybe even review your studio goals and exit notes. What things have you done this semester?
<!-- * **Choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you. NB: THIS MAKES MORE SENSE AS THE FINAL HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT--></li>

  <li><em>Preparing one final project or revision:</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>By the end of next class</em>, you should decide (together, if working on a team) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project for the consolidation/integration unit, and what series of stretch goals you’ll try for beyond that minimum.</li>
      <li>To get there, work through the questions from the EXT above, and write a brief project pitch on the <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes#heading=h.leh3pxuj6n6n">shared Google doc</a></li>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref1" id="ftn1" class="ftn">[1]</a> Twine is a digital platform for storyboarding interactive narratives, and the output of that platform is <em>a</em> Twine.

I've recorded a roughly <a href="https://pitt.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=692b738b-6b8a-431b-974f-ac0e013ce90c">10-minute screencast intro to Twine</a> and why I think it's useful now, which you can check out later if you're intrigued.

# Intro to Final Portfolio + Virtual Studio

**Work to have done**:

* Work in pursuit of a Preview for your Consolidation Unit Project (proposals should all be on the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/13) by now)


**Plan for the day**:

1. Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)
2. Reminders
3. Set an intention
4. Studio time!
5. Exit note

Today is mostly like the other distant-learning studios: I'll be online, but you are not required to join the Zoom (though you're certainly welcome, even if you don't have questions).

That being said...

<div class="alert alert-white">
<ul>
  <li>You <em>are</em> expected to post notes on your intention at the beginning and progress by the end of whatever time you spend; I'll be using those notes as a way of taking today's attendance.
    <ul>
      <li>Because this is asynchronous, though, you have all of Thursday to check in. (And if it's there by Friday morning, I'll consider it as having been done on Thursday. :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You should also read the information below about my expectations for your final portfolios, including the linked handout.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## 1. Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)

The final portfolio will consist of a single post on the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}) (thread coming soon), containing:

1.	a **prose reflection** of at least 800-1200 words (1200-1800 recommended), reflecting on the course and framing the portfolioâ€™s contents in terms of your learning and goals;
    * NB: I have a **[handout](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020spring/blob/gh-pages/uploads/handout--final-portfolio-prompt.docx?raw=true)** with guidelines and prompts for this reflection. You don't have to print it out, but please do read it!
2.	**representative thumbnails, hyperlinked to final versions** of your four unit projects, i.e. Soundscape Narrative, Visual Argument, Website, and Collaboration;
3.	**links to your repositories** (on either GitHub or Box) for each of those pieces; and
4.	**a thumbnail of at least one specific prior draft, hyperlinked to that file in the revision history**, allowing you to talk about your revision skills.

In addition to the portfolio, or as preparation for it, I encourage you to retake the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey) from the start of the semester. Among other things, it'll give you a space to officially tell me whether and how I can use your work as an example in future semesters.

<div class="alert alert-info">
NB: There is no separate reflection deadline for the consolidation unit; you can just include that in the final reflection for the semester.
</div>

Have questions about all that? You're probably not alone! Please [create a new post]({{site.github.issues_url}}/new) on the issue queue and I'll respond where everyone can see it.

## 2. Reminders
Working on our own times, there are still ways to reach out to each other:

* _My online office_, for the duration of the semester, will be at [https://pitt.zoom.us/j/4969331343](https://pitt.zoom.us/j/4969331343). Barring homelife interruptions, I'm going to try to have that room open whenever class would be in session, plus my office hours on Wed/Thurs from 12-1. **I'll be there during today's studio hours, if you want to drop in!** I'm happy to help where I can, and screensharing is often really useful.

* _The google doc_ that we've been using for shared notes, at [http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria](http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria), will have new spaces where I'll ask you to check in briefly at the start and end of your own personal class time, mainly during studio days. (See below for some prompts.)

* And of course you can also find each other on GitHub, including on the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}) and the links from there to your various repositories. Filing a help request on the issue queue will be one of the best ways to make sure I help answer your questions: it'll help me keep track of what I've responded to (and what I haven't), and it'll prompt you to give me the info I need to respond more swiftly (like screenshots and links).


## 3. Set an intention
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you start your solo time today, <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.vv41f9hb2m9w">head over to the google doc</a> and write a quick line about what you hope to accomplish with your remaining time. e.g. Will you...
  <ul>
    <li>Locate tutorials (for what)?</li>
    <li>Gather assets you can use in your project?</li>
    <li>Write code, public-facing copy, something for yourself to help clarify your idea?</li>
    <li>etc etc</li>
  </ul>
Just a sentence or two as a guidepost will give you something to come back to, to reorient, if you find yourself walking in circles or caught in a thicket.
</div>


## 4. Studio
<!-- <div class="alert alert-success"> -->
Take 70 minutes, and subtract however long you just spent reading the sections above. Then give yourself reminders to stretch, save, and write commit messages as you go!
<!-- </div> -->

I'll be online [in Zoom](https://pitt.zoom.us/j/4969331343) from 2:30-3:45pm.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as a project file, if appropriate</li>
   <li>as a git commit, saying what you've just achieved</li>
   <li>as a screenshot</li>
 </ul>
</div>

## 5. Quick report back

Before you leave, just as a way for me to check in, I'd like to hear more about what happened today: did you find images? Level up on a particular CSS skill? Decide something about your project? Raise a question in a new way that you'd like some help with?

<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>Head back into the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.vv41f9hb2m9w">google doc</a> and reply to your intention-post.</strong> You could email me directly if you prefer, but I'm hoping some of your insights or achievements will help inspire others.
</div>

# Homework for next time

Your individual tasks will be determined by your projects; if you're working in a group, make sure you discuss your timing and tasks with each other.

**Whatever you choose, I'm hoping that by Tuesday you'll be able to produce some kind of _Draft_.** Polish isn't necessary, but aim to have your project be recognizably within the genre it's trying to become.

Given the variation in media and intentions, we don't have a coherent set of shared criteria, but if you don't have past criteria to go by (e.g. for revisions and extension projects), it's worth thinking about how we've developed criteria in the past: What do you value in similar work by other people? What strikes you as a reasonable baseline for completion? What are your stretch goals and aspirations beyond that?



<div class="alert alert-warning">
Thanks for bearing with me through these weird working conditions, everyone!

# Visual Unit Studio

**Work to have achieved**:
* Review the [resources page]({{site.github_url}}/resources) and unit assignment [goals and options](https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage)
* Do at least 1-2 tutorials from [gimp.org/tutorials](https://gimp.org/tutorials)
* Write a [visual rhetoric proposal]({{site.github.issues_url}})

**Plan for the day**:

1. Guiding thoughts for Studio (5-15 min)
2. Studio time (50-55 min)
3. Exit note (5 min)


## 1. Gathering thoughts for Studio (5-10 min)

### GIMP Notes
* GIMP's toolbox is kinda cluttered, but the tools are also indexed by category in the menu bar, helpfully, under Tools. (And every tool has a keyboard shortcut, too: may be worth memorizing your go-to instruments.)
* There's often extra tips for the tool you're using under the editing window, in a tiny font; try holding shift, alt, control, command, etc while you click or drag to see what it says/does.
* Remember our strategies for drawing attention, which you can use to signal your hierarchy through scale, value, color, proximity, and style: [bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria](http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8) (see the section on "Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric").

### Writing as Processing
According to [Thompson](https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy) (our reading from last week), **you can reliably convey only about three levels of dominance**; after that, it starts to get mushy.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take a few minutes to write, with your own proposed visual argument / rhetorical collage in mind:
<ul>
<li>What options do you have for putting in your top three? What's next in line?</li>
<li>How would the layout need to change if you changed your ranking, e.g. if you put one of your current tier-twos into the top slot?</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Timing Reminder / HW Preview
Some preview of the project will be due before next class, just to make sure you're all getting started on it.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Therefore, the rest of today's class is all about working on your individual projects! <strong>Find source images or text, level up on layering, watch relevant tutorials on effects or on layout, and see what happens when you apply them to your own digital canvas.</strong></div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
At the end of class, I'll ask you to send me a note (email's fine) letting me know what you worked on, and how it's going.
</div>

I know your lives are busy; take advantage of this dedicated time free from other distractions and obligations to move your piece forward. At the same time, it's worth noting that you're working _in a shared space_, in a studio. If you have questions, or you want feedback on something, you have your classmates and your instructor on-hand. Try not to monopolize anyone's time, but do be open to the possibility of getting farther together than you could on your own.

<div class="alert alert-white">
p.s. If you need sonic isolation to work, I recommend <a href="http://noisli.com">noisli.com</a>, which lets you modularly adjust about a dozen different kinds of background sounds, from cafes to trains to white and pink noise.
</div>

## 3. Quick report back (with 10 min left)

Just as a way for me to check in, I'd like to hear more about what happened today: did you find images? Level up on a particular GIMP skill? Decide something about your project? Raise a question in a new way that you'd like some help with?

Take five minutes to send me a quick email. If everyone finishes early, we can hear from a few volunteers out loud.


## Homework for next time

* **Read** about fonts, if you haven't yet, at [https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/](https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/).
   - Optionally, **play** a font-matching game at [www.typeconnection.com](http://www.typeconnection.com/) to get a sense of (a) what sorts of fonts are out there and (b) how designers go about pairing fonts for what Thompson called hierarchy by "style."

* Compose a **Visual Argument Preview**: an early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning, to get practice with GIMP, and to start testing out the ideas from your proposal (or beyond). To submit, please **Push to your repository** the following:
   <ul>
   <li> A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.xcf)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and text so far (need not be a complete argument or collage yet).</li>
   <li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts). If you can capture a moment of success or stuckness, all the better.</li>
   <li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in around 300 or more words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li>
   <li> An updated <strong>assets.md</strong> file, now with the files you're actually obtained. As you go, add source documentation for any outside sources â€“ and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165). <ul><li>If you prefer, you can create a new CREDITS.md file for this, preserving the assets list for things you're still seeking.</li></ul></li>
   <li>An <strong>exported .png file</strong>. As with Audacity, GIMP's default save mode is a complex / modular "project file," of type .xcf; should the project fail to load, it would be great to have a simple image file as a backup. We won't be able to see how you achieved your layout, but we will be able to see the image. <ul><li><em>Sweet bonus:</em> you'll also be able to use GitHub history to compare one .png to another, side by side, or even slide to reveal the change. Pretty cool, no?</li></ul></li>
   </ul>

# Visual Unit Workshop

**Work to have done**: a solid attempt at a complete visual argument, ideally meeting baseline criteria. Rough edges are still welcome.


**Plan for the day**:

1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW Preview


## 1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)

<!-- This is the same process as last time, but not everyone was doing it. Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by naming what you value. -->

To help maximize what you learn both in receiving _and in giving_ feedback, please work in the following three steps:

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol>
   <li>First <strong>describe</strong> what you see,
   <!-- Test whether the audience is getting the main point you want to get across. --></li>
   <li>Then <strong>evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses some shared criteria, <!-- NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --> and</li> <li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria.  <!-- NB: a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

I have here to return to you the index cards from the audio unit – not from the comments you *received*, but the comments you *gave*. Read them over. Were you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? For example, **can you tell from the cards what you were reacting to**? If so, be proud! See if you can do it again in a new sensory mode. If not, strive to level up today: **train your attention to see, and describe, before judging.**

## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
We set up a few shared goals and constraints [bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.r8cu792fqkxb) to meet the baseline requirements. Let's try to help everyone get at least to there!

**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention
* Have a clear message or intervention
* If including at least one word, use a carefully chosen font
* If using no words, be sure to clarify your intention and choice in the reflection
* Use a purposeful color palette
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 1 GIMP tool beyond select, move, and text (e.g. dodge, burn, clone tool, stamp tool)
* For all of the above, argue in the reflection why you did what you did

**Aspirational inspirations**
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

* Collaborate with the machine by using GIMP automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)
* Incorporate surprising juxtaposition (as appropriate)
* Use overlapping pictures/sizing to showcase depth and distance, create 3D space
* Use folders to group layers
* Use layer masks for advanced combining / reveals etc
* Practice using additional GIMP tools/filters that are new to you
* Create the illusion of seamlessness
* Create your own visual assets (photography, drawing, etc)
* Use “[keywords toward a visual rhetoric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8)” (scale, density, etc) to analyze/explain your design
* Demonstrate that viewers understand your intention
* Use git/GitHub with meaningful commit messages, if that’s still new/challenging



## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)

Let's do this!

<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, <ol><li>load up your GIMP project, and</li><li>label <strong>three</strong> index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.</li></ol>
</div>

Then...

<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate *counter*-clockwise around the monitor-islands, so that you're getting feedback from (and seeing the project of) someone new. Label <em>one</em> index card <strong>From: {yourname}</strong>. View / read through the project fully at least once, then

<ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see, without judging whether it's good or not. What seems to be the top-level focus? What's next in the hierarchy? Can you say back the argument/claim/intervention? <!-- Help learn how the eye is drawn.  --></li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> with reference to our shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project.  <!-- NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --> </li>
<li><strong>Suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, and the criteria, what might be next? <!-- NB: a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

I'll keep track of time.
<!--
first rotation starts ~2:47
second rotation starts 2:58
third rotation starts 3:08
-->

On subsequent loops, note that **after** viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards.

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Head back to your seats and take a minute to read **and photograph** the notes you've received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I'll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)

Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?


# Homework for Next Time

* Next class will be a graphic designers' studio: **bring headphones for [sonic isolation](http://noisli.com)**, and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your visual argument / rhetorical collage.
  - The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the [rhetorical collage prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#deadlines-and-products) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale (again), I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture (again!). **Write a short blog post** thinking about possible group projects you'd like to try for the end of term.
  - What further possibilities of graphic design might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}); like last time, there is no minimum length requirement, but it's a good opportunity to shape the group unit to match your interests!


## EXT:
If any time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!

**Writing to turn in:**

* A post to the main course [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/1), introducing yourself to your classmates (and anyone else who stumbles upon it)


## Plan for the Day

1. Contract questions?
2. Five Principles, in Brief (15 min)
3. GitHub, part 2  <!-- repo, commit, history, diff --> (15 min)
4. Five Principles as Lenses (15 min)


### 1. Contract questions?
Anyone have any questions about the grading contract, or changes to propose?

### 2. Five Principles, in Brief
We have a couple of new students, and also Margaret, our TA. Welcome!

Can I get five people to fill them in on the five "principles of new media" from the article I asked you to read? i.e. One person, one term.

<!-- numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability,
and transcoding -->

<!-- If you had to look them up, would you rather use the webtext or the pdf? Why? -->

### 3. GitHub, part 2
Last time, we saw that GitHub can host a discussion forum, so in that sense it's a community website: it makes media social.

But its core functionality is meant to solve a different media problem:

<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's quickly walk through what it looks like:
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo#readme">https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo</a></strong>
</div>

<!--
1. Create a new .txt file.
2. Demo the importance of the extension by previewing what happens if it's .md?
3. Commit the new file directly to master.
    - Note that the commit message has two parts: a short label, and a bigger box. These are kind of like the subject line of an email and the email body. The first is what you'll see automatically when browsing the history; the second will require an additional click. And GitHub will let you leave the "body" blank, but you're required to have a "subject line."
4. Change the text.
5. Create a new branch, then merge it. Why, you ask?
   It matters when you're working with others: you want to make sure you're comparing against the most up-to-date version, so you don't accidentally erase something new.
   This will become important in a minute.

### 4. Five Principles as Lenses

Time to take these abstractions and put them into practice, in two ways:

* practice using GitHub
* practice using our key terms to help us see differently

We'll be working in groups. Can I get about five volunteers who are feeling good about GitHub to anchor those teams for today?

<div class="alert alert-success">
Head to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/digital-affordances-2020spring#readme">https://github.com/benmiller314/digital-affordances-2020spring</a></strong>, where you'll find more instructions for what to do next – starting with forking the repo. (Thanks, anchors!)

Then follow the instructions in the README file.
</div>

We'll work for 10-15 minutes, then report back.

## HW for next time:

* **Watch** Git and GitHub for Poets, starting at least with
[the Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) and going as far as your interest and time allow. <!-- FOR NEXT TIME: add [1.5 intro to the command line](https://youtu.be/oK8EvVeVltE) and recommend [1.6 clone, push, pull](https://youtu.be/yXT1ElMEkW8), though it's a little long-winded -->
* **Practice** following the steps in the video, using either a .txt file or a .md file: create a repository on GitHub, add some content to a file, commit, edit it, commit again, and view the history. Next class we can start with any questions that came up for you in the process.
   - If you've used GitHub a lot, you may want to play around with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) formatting. Do you know what happens if you embed html inside a Markdown file? Or Markdown inside an html block?
   * **Download** any software you'll need [to use Git at the command line](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03), possibly including Homebrew (on Mac) and GitBash (on Windows)
     - If you're feeling intimidated by the command line but want to give it a go, try out this [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
   * *Optional but highly recommended:* Also **download** the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com), available for MacOS or Windows. <!-- FOR NEXT TIME: ALSO HAVE THEM DOWNLOAD ATOM, so they can do the local text editing required in lesson 3! -->
* *Optional:* Want a more hands-on guide through the full GitHub functionality? See the GitHub Learning Lab entry on our [Resources page]({{site.github_url}}/resources).

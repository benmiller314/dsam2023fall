<h1 id="visual-unit-workshop">Visual Unit Workshop</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>: a solid attempt at a complete visual argument, ideally meeting baseline criteria. Rough edges are still welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)</li>
  <li>Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation revisited (10 min)</li>
  <li>HW Preview</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-workflow-reminder-describe---evaluate---suggest-5-min">1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</h2>

<!-- This is the same process as last time, but not everyone was doing it. Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by naming what you value. -->

<p>To help maximize what you learn both in receiving <em>and in giving</em> feedback, please work in the following three steps:</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol>
   <li>First <strong>describe</strong> what you see,
   <!-- Test whether the audience is getting the main point you want to get across. --></li>
   <li>Then <strong>evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses some shared criteria, <!-- NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --> and</li> <li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria.  <!-- NB: a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>I have here to return to you the index cards from the audio unit – not from the comments you <em>received</em>, but the comments you <em>gave</em>. Read them over. Were you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? For example, <strong>can you tell from the cards what you were reacting to</strong>? If so, be proud! See if you can do it again in a new sensory mode. If not, strive to level up today: <strong>train your attention to see, and describe, before judging.</strong></p>

<h2 id="2-evaluation-reminder-our-criteria-5-min">2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)</h2>
<p>We set up a few shared goals and constraints <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.r8cu792fqkxb">bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria</a> to meet the baseline requirements. Let’s try to help everyone get at least to there!</p>

<p><strong>Baseline criteria</strong>
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers’ attention</li>
  <li>Have a clear message or intervention</li>
  <li>If including at least one word, use a carefully chosen font</li>
  <li>If using no words, be sure to clarify your intention and choice in the reflection</li>
  <li>Use a purposeful color palette</li>
  <li>Use at least 3 layers</li>
  <li>Use at least 1 GIMP tool beyond select, move, and text (e.g. dodge, burn, clone tool, stamp tool)</li>
  <li>For all of the above, argue in the reflection why you did what you did</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aspirational inspirations</strong>
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collaborate with the machine by using GIMP automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)</li>
  <li>Incorporate surprising juxtaposition (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>Use overlapping pictures/sizing to showcase depth and distance, create 3D space</li>
  <li>Use folders to group layers</li>
  <li>Use layer masks for advanced combining / reveals etc</li>
  <li>Practice using additional GIMP tools/filters that are new to you</li>
  <li>Create the illusion of seamlessness</li>
  <li>Create your own visual assets (photography, drawing, etc)</li>
  <li>Use “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8">keywords toward a visual rhetoric</a>” (scale, density, etc) to analyze/explain your design</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that viewers understand your intention</li>
  <li>Use git/GitHub with meaningful commit messages, if that’s still new/challenging</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-peer-review-workshop-3-times-10-12-min">3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</h2>

<p>Let’s do this!</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, <ol><li>load up your GIMP project, and</li><li>label <strong>three</strong> index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.</li></ol>
</div>

<p>Then…</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate *counter*-clockwise around the monitor-islands, so that you're getting feedback from (and seeing the project of) someone new. Label <em>one</em> index card <strong>From: {yourname}</strong>. View / read through the project fully at least once, then

<ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see, without judging whether it's good or not. What seems to be the top-level focus? What's next in the hierarchy? Can you say back the argument/claim/intervention? <!-- Help learn how the eye is drawn.  --></li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> with reference to our shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project.  <!-- NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --> </li>
<li><strong>Suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, and the criteria, what might be next? <!-- NB: a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>I’ll keep track of time.
<!--
first rotation starts ~2:47
second rotation starts 2:58
third rotation starts 3:08
--></p>

<p>On subsequent loops, note that <strong>after</strong> viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards.</p>

<h2 id="4-evaluation-revisited-10-min">4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)</h2>
<p>Head back to your seats and take a minute to read <strong>and photograph</strong> the notes you’ve received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I’ll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)</p>

<p>Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?</p>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for Next Time</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Next class will be a graphic designers’ studio: <strong>bring headphones for <a href="http://noisli.com">sonic isolation</a></strong>, and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your visual argument / rhetorical collage.
    <ul>
      <li>The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#deadlines-and-products">rhetorical collage prompt</a> for further details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale (again), I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture (again!). <strong>Write a short blog post</strong> thinking about possible group projects you’d like to try for the end of term.
    <ul>
      <li>What further possibilities of graphic design might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?</li>
      <li>You can post this to the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">Issue Queue</a>; like last time, there is no minimum length requirement, but it’s a good opportunity to shape the group unit to match your interests!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If any time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!</p>

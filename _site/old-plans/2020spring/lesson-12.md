# Visual Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals

**Work to have done**:

* Work on your visual arguments, and push a _[rhetorical collage preview](https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#deadlines-and-products)_ to GitHub: .xcf file, GIMP screenshot, and text description, plus updated list of assets/credits. Exported .png or .jpg strongly encouraged.

**Plan for the Day**:
1. Reflective writing (5 min)
2. Refresher on visual arguments we've liked (5 min)
3. Gathering criteria (45 min)
4. Sources, assets, permissions, citations (5-10 min)
5. EXT: Studio and microconferences

<!-- Introduce Annette Vee: she's here to help me reflect on my teaching and keep getting better, just like you help each other see your projects through other eyes and keep getting better in the process. -->

## 1. Reflective writing (5 min) <!-- we get here at 2:38 -->
<div class="alert alert-success">
In your own space – you won't have to share this unless you want to – do a little writing about your visual argument in progress. What's exciting about it? What's challenging about it? What are you unsure of?
</div>

## 2. Refresher on visual arguments we've liked (5 min)
Shift now in your writing to think about the [blog posts on rhetorical collages in the wild]({{site.github.issues_url}}/6) – or, if you haven't read through them in a while, look at them quickly now with an eye toward _what people are praising_ in these images:  **what seems to make a visual design work well, especially for making some intervention in the world or the viewer? Jot down some notes.**

## 3. Gathering criteria (45 min)
Primed now by that writing and thinking, I'm going to ask you to get in groups and brainstorm in pursuit of baseline and aspirational criteria for this unit.

### 3a. Let's group up by table again
Aim for 3-5 people per group. (If you end up with 6, split into two groups. Less than three, join another small group.)

NB: Getting the monitors out of the way seems to work best if you face the wires toward the holes, even though it means you'll be looking at the screens' backs.

### 3b. Crowdsource ideas (10 min) <!-- start at ~2:53 -->
To bring all our notes together while allowing for real-time collaboration, **use this google doc: [bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria](http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.ed20d8tt2mfr).**

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take 10 minutes in groups to make some lists: given the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage">goals of the unit</a>, what should we set as our minimum criteria for full credit? What are some ways we might push beyond that minimum – not merely in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality or challenge level?

That is, <strong>I really want you to see these aspirational goals as opportunities to stretch yourselves and your skills, not just to do more of the same.</strong> Think about what would be new and potentially exciting – but not required for everyone.
</div>

EXT: If your group feels finished, skip ahead: read through other groups' notes, or start gathering thoughts on fonts and/or GIMP.

### 3c. Discuss and Integrate (30 min)
Quickly read through the other groups' notes, adding comments in the margins to upvote or propose modifications. As you see consensus forming, propose an official version for our list of shared criteria. If debates emerge, we can hash them out.

<!-- NOTES FROM ANNETTE:
Tensions between what you're saying and what we're doing:  
* I say it's their language to contribute, but sometimes your responses override what students suggest.
* Wait longer after asking a question
 * Only a few confident enough to push back:
  * What's their incentive to participate? They'd already written it, no clear need to talk about it more. Especially if their language is just being changed by you.
* WHAT IF YOU: **give them 30 minutes to work on their projects** once the group sections of the doc are filled out and commented on. During that time, synthesize the conversation on your own, making sure to show where their input is valued (e.g. use their language). Then at end of class (last 10 min? 15?), come back with a draft for them to read through and raise questions about (or affirm). 
-->

We'll refine as a group, and repeat, and then come back and revise after Tuesday's workshop.

### EXT: sharing insights
If we have time left, make two quick lists (just about a minute each):
1. Things I've learned about fonts (or GIMP)
2. Questions I have about fonts (or GIMP)

Share within your group, using what you've learned to try to answer each others' questions.

## For next time:
* **Work** to bring in a full draft: a solid attempt at a complete visual argument, ideally meeting baseline criteria. Rough edges are still welcome.
* **Continue** taking periodic screenshots and posting meaningful commit messages in Git
* **Remember** that you should give your project a name you can continue using through the final draft, so you can track the changes with version control
* **Push** a full draft, with the same four parts as the preview *plus* an updated file crediting your sources and permissions/license to use them
  - NB: I'm only suggesting all-caps for special files readers might want to find quickly. It kind of loses the effect if everything is in caps. (Better to be all lowercase, if you have to choose.)
  - Whether Box or GitHub, double-check that you can open the file: try downloading it into a different location. If it doesn't open with all the layers you'd want, try saving the project again. (You may have exported the first time.)
* **Bring** a camera (phone is fine), to take photos of feedback received

<!-- * NB: If GitHub is giving you trouble, you can use Box instead. Just make sure that you...
  - add a link to the Box folder at the top of your GitHub README.md file.
  - grant me (or the whole organization, which is Pitt) Downloader or Editor permissions in the Box folder
  - put all the same files in the Box folder as you would have in GitHub. -->


<!--
<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>If you couldn't get git-lfs working</strong>, and even a zip file is too big for GitHub, <a href="http://pitt.box.com">you can use Box</a> to share your Audacity file and its associated data folder. But please still do use git to keep track of your revision choices when possible, perhaps by committing screenshots. And may I suggest adding a link to your Box folder in your GitHub repository's README.md?

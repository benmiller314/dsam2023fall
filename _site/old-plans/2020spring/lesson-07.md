# Sound Workshop

**Work to have done**: a complete-as-possible draft of your soundscape narratives, aiming for [the baseline criteria we agreed on](http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.ik63yjqpqrt3)

**Plan for the day**:

1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW Preview


## 1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)

Today is all about getting _feedback_ for your projects. What does that metaphor mean? It's a process by which the output is picked up again as input. You've brought in your output so far; now you're going to learn by getting input from your audience.

<!-- A lot of peer review fails because it falls to one of two extremes: noncommittal nods, or non-stop nitpicking. Neither really takes advantage of the output we have in front of us. -->

To avoid some of the pitfalls of peer review, I'm going to insist that you provide this feedback in three steps:
<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you hear, <em>without judging whether it's good or not</em>. What is this project? What do you think is happening? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- A lot of times as writers, even soundwriters, we don't even know if our audience is getting the main point we want to get across.  --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to our shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and interpret these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

We're going to be doing this all on index cards, which don't give you a ton of space: try to focus your response on what seems most important to the piece. (I'll ask you to photograph the cards for your own records, but turn them in to me before you leave, so I can get an overall sense of where we are as a group.)

## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
We set up a few [shared goals and constraints](http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.ik63yjqpqrt3) to meet the baseline requirements. Let's try to help everyone get at least to there!
> * Play for 2-4 minutes
> * Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you
> * Contain at least one sound not recorded by you, but which you have permission (e.g. CC license, fair use, etc) to use
> * Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file
> * Have something change from the beginning to the end of the piece
> * Meet deadlines and requirements from [the assignment README](https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape2020spring#deadlines-and-products) (see: citation, reflection, project title)
> * Export a playable ("rendered") .mp3 file


We also have some stretch goals, or aspirations. In offering suggestions, these are some (but not the only) good targets to aim for!
> * Use relative volume and other effects to signal distance
> * Use left/right pan to create a sense of (locations in) space
> * IF dialogue, some should be clear
> * Clear organizational scheme that you can articulate
>   - e.g. Seamless transitions from scene to scene / clip to clip
>   - e.g. Sharp cuts to delineate scenes
> * Audience interpretation matches what you intended
> * Show off how many sounds you can overlap without losing focus
> * Have an emotional or intellectual intention that you can articulate
> * Use Audacity effects that are new to you

<!-- one more suggestion, from last year: Practice careful _alignment_ (e.g. of music change with plot change, or an interesting background moment with silence in the foreground) -->

## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)

Let's do this!
<div class="alert alert-info">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your Audacity project, (2) plug in your headphones, and (3) label <em>*three*</em> index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
Then...
<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate clockwise around the monitor-islands. Label <em>*one*</em> index card <em>From: {yourname}</em>. Listen to the project fully at least once, then (1) <strong>Describe</strong> what you hear, (2) <strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria, (3) <strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!
</div>

I'll keep track of time.

On subsequent loops, note that you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards... but please do so only **after** listening to the project first.

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Head back to your seats and take a minute to read **and photograph** the notes you've received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I'll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)

<div class="alert alert-white">
EXT: Based on your listening, would anyone like to propose new or modified baseline criteria, or suggest some new aspirational goals? Where did your listening inspire you?
</div>


# Homework for Next Time

* **Next class will be a sound-writers' studio:** bring headphones and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your soundscape narrative.
  - The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the [soundscape prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape2020spring) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale, I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture. **Write a short blog post** thinking about possible group projects you'd like to try for the end of term.
  - What further possibilities of sound might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}); there is no minimum length requirement.



## EXT:
If time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!

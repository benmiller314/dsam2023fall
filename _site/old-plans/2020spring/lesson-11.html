<h1 id="visual-unit-studio">Visual Unit Studio</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have achieved</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources">resources page</a> and unit assignment <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020spring#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage">goals and options</a></li>
  <li>Do at least 1-2 tutorials from <a href="https://gimp.org/tutorials">gimp.org/tutorials</a></li>
  <li>Write a <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">visual rhetoric proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Guiding thoughts for Studio (5-15 min)</li>
  <li>Studio time (50-55 min)</li>
  <li>Exit note (5 min)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-gathering-thoughts-for-studio-5-10-min">1. Gathering thoughts for Studio (5-10 min)</h2>

<h3 id="gimp-notes">GIMP Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>GIMP’s toolbox is kinda cluttered, but the tools are also indexed by category in the menu bar, helpfully, under Tools. (And every tool has a keyboard shortcut, too: may be worth memorizing your go-to instruments.)</li>
  <li>There’s often extra tips for the tool you’re using under the editing window, in a tiny font; try holding shift, alt, control, command, etc while you click or drag to see what it says/does.</li>
  <li>Remember our strategies for drawing attention, which you can use to signal your hierarchy through scale, value, color, proximity, and style: <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8">bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria</a> (see the section on “Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric”).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-as-processing">Writing as Processing</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">Thompson</a> (our reading from last week), <strong>you can reliably convey only about three levels of dominance</strong>; after that, it starts to get mushy.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take a few minutes to write, with your own proposed visual argument / rhetorical collage in mind:
<ul>
<li>What options do you have for putting in your top three? What's next in line?</li>
<li>How would the layout need to change if you changed your ranking, e.g. if you put one of your current tier-twos into the top slot?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="timing-reminder--hw-preview">Timing Reminder / HW Preview</h3>
<p>Some preview of the project will be due before next class, just to make sure you’re all getting started on it.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Therefore, the rest of today's class is all about working on your individual projects! <strong>Find source images or text, level up on layering, watch relevant tutorials on effects or on layout, and see what happens when you apply them to your own digital canvas.</strong></div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
At the end of class, I'll ask you to send me a note (email's fine) letting me know what you worked on, and how it's going.
</div>

<p>I know your lives are busy; take advantage of this dedicated time free from other distractions and obligations to move your piece forward. At the same time, it’s worth noting that you’re working <em>in a shared space</em>, in a studio. If you have questions, or you want feedback on something, you have your classmates and your instructor on-hand. Try not to monopolize anyone’s time, but do be open to the possibility of getting farther together than you could on your own.</p>

<div class="alert alert-white">
p.s. If you need sonic isolation to work, I recommend <a href="http://noisli.com">noisli.com</a>, which lets you modularly adjust about a dozen different kinds of background sounds, from cafes to trains to white and pink noise.
</div>

<h2 id="3-quick-report-back-with-10-min-left">3. Quick report back (with 10 min left)</h2>

<p>Just as a way for me to check in, I’d like to hear more about what happened today: did you find images? Level up on a particular GIMP skill? Decide something about your project? Raise a question in a new way that you’d like some help with?</p>

<p>Take five minutes to send me a quick email. If everyone finishes early, we can hear from a few volunteers out loud.</p>

<h2 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong> about fonts, if you haven’t yet, at <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/">https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Optionally, <strong>play</strong> a font-matching game at <a href="http://www.typeconnection.com/">www.typeconnection.com</a> to get a sense of (a) what sorts of fonts are out there and (b) how designers go about pairing fonts for what Thompson called hierarchy by “style.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compose a <strong>Visual Argument Preview</strong>: an early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning, to get practice with GIMP, and to start testing out the ideas from your proposal (or beyond). To submit, please <strong>Push to your repository</strong> the following:
    <ul>
 <li> A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.xcf)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and text so far (need not be a complete argument or collage yet).</li>
 <li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts). If you can capture a moment of success or stuckness, all the better.</li>
 <li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in around 300 or more words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li>
 <li> An updated <strong>assets.md</strong> file, now with the files you're actually obtained. As you go, add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165). <ul><li>If you prefer, you can create a new CREDITS.md file for this, preserving the assets list for things you're still seeking.</li></ul></li>
 <li>An <strong>exported .png file</strong>. As with Audacity, GIMP's default save mode is a complex / modular "project file," of type .xcf; should the project fail to load, it would be great to have a simple image file as a backup. We won't be able to see how you achieved your layout, but we will be able to see the image. <ul><li><em>Sweet bonus:</em> you'll also be able to use GitHub history to compare one .png to another, side by side, or even slide to reveal the change. Pretty cool, no?</li></ul></li>
 </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

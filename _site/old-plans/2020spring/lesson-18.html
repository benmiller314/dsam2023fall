<h1 id="web-unit-criteria-and-stretch-goals">Web Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work on your websites, and push a <em><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/website-portfolio-2020spring#deadlines-and-products">preview</a></em> to GitHub: in-progress docs folder with html file(s), css file(s), and any other assets (e.g. images), plus a screenshot, text description, and updated credits/list of desired assets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the Day</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reflective writing (5 min)</li>
  <li>Websites we’ve liked – within reach (5 min)</li>
  <li>Gathering criteria (20-25 min)</li>
  <li>NEW! Studio while I synthesize (30 min)</li>
  <li>Confirming criteria (10 min)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-reflective-writing-5-min-">1. Reflective writing (5 min) <!-- we start at 2:34 --></h2>
<div class="alert alert-success">
In your own space – you won't have to share this unless you want to – do a little writing about your website in progress. What's exciting about it? What's challenging about it? What are you unsure of?
</div>

<h2 id="2-websites-weve-liked--within-reach-5-min">2. Websites we’ve liked – within reach (5 min)</h2>
<p>Shift now in your writing to think about the websites you navigate every day. <strong>What seems to make them easy to get through, to find what you need? What causes frustration? How do you think its <em>structure</em> might be related to its <em>audience</em>?</strong> Jot down some notes.</p>

<h2 id="3-gathering-criteria-20-min">3. Gathering criteria (20 min)</h2>
<p>Primed now by that writing and thinking, I’m going to ask you to get in groups and brainstorm in pursuit of baseline and aspirational criteria for this unit.</p>

<h3 id="3a-crowdsource-ideas-10-min-">3a. Crowdsource ideas (10 min) <!-- start at ~2:53 --></h3>
<p>To bring all our notes together while allowing for real-time collaboration, <strong>head into our google doc: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.z8d1igk08a86">bit.ly/cdm2020spring-criteria</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take 10 minutes in groups to make some lists: given the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/website-portfolio-2020spring#project-3-website-portfolio">goals of the unit</a>, what should we set as our minimum criteria for full credit? What are some ways we might push beyond that minimum – not just in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality?

That is, <strong>I really want you to see these aspirational goals as opportunities to stretch yourselves and your skills, not just to do more of the same.</strong> Think about what would be new and potentially exciting, but not required for everyone.
</div>

<!-- Aspirations I want to suggest include:
Use comments in your html and css to explain (including to yourself) what you're trying to do
-->

<h3 id="3b-comment-and-discuss-in-the-doc-10-min">3b. Comment and Discuss in the Doc (10 min)</h3>
<p>Quickly read through the other groups’ notes, adding collegial comments in the margins to upvote or propose modifications.</p>

<p>As you see consensus forming, propose an official version for our list of shared criteria. If debates emerge, maybe we can use mutually exclusive aspirational goals…</p>

<h2 id="4-new-studio-while-i-synthesize-30-min">4. NEW! Studio While I Synthesize (30 min)</h2>

<p>After Dr. Vee’s visit during our last criteria day, she and I discussed the ways that energy flagged at this point in the lesson. So instead of dragging everyone along through every possible criterion, <strong>I’m going to work solo to write up a list that reflects your consensus in the comments, while you all work solo (or in small groups) on your projects and tutorials.</strong></p>

<p>Then we’ll reconvene at the end of the class to ratify or modify what I’ve come up with, in one fell swoop.</p>

<h2 id="5-confirming-criteria-10-min">5. Confirming criteria (10 min)</h2>

<p>Let’s head back to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QF00VYOEYDVJ2ciloO0jzZxE3MBaetN-ooVeuHVVLQ/edit#heading=h.z8d1igk08a86">the doc</a>…</p>

<h2 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do</strong> more of the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">tutorial</a>, including at least the section on Semantic HTML (12) if you haven’t yet: it’ll get you out of div soup!
    <ul>
      <li>Optionally check out the section on Web Typography (14), e.g. if you’re trying to bring in a custom font; and if you’re having trouble getting something to position properly even after working through Flexbox (8) and the Grid tutorial in Medium, try the section on Advanced Positioning (9).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Work</strong> to bring in a full draft: a solid attempt at a complete website, ideally meeting baseline criteria. Rough edges are still welcome.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue</strong> taking periodic screenshots and posting meaningful commit messages in Git</li>
  <li>By Thursday after break, <strong>push</strong> a full draft, with the same parts as the preview: docs folder with html file(s), css file(s), and any other assets (e.g. images), plus a screenshot, text description, and updated credits/list of desired assets.
    <ul>
      <li>NB: As I mentioned in the readme file inside the docs folder, <strong>your home page should be called index.html</strong> to properly load in the browser.</li>
      <li>Also: I’m only suggesting all-caps for special files readers might want to find quickly; it kind of loses the effect if everything is in caps. <em>Better to be all lowercase, if you have to choose.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bring</strong> a camera (phone is fine), to take photos of feedback received</li>
</ul>

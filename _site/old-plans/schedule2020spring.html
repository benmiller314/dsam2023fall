As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.</em></p>

<p>I'm getting the sense that enforced collaboration is <em>not</em> the best way forward when we can't reliably meet and look at things together. Instead, in this unit I'll ask you to build on what you've already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team that can collaborate effectively via online formats (via Zoom, Discord, Slack, what-have-you), that's up to you!</p>

<p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p>

  <li>Make a new repository (GH, Box, or Drive) containing a task list for your project – along with proposed roles for your team members, if you have a team of more than one.
    <ul>
      <li>If you’re updating an existing project, do this in a new branch of the old repository, instead.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Post a link to this repository on the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">Issue Queue</a>.</li>
  <li>Decide (together, if applicable) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project, and what series of stretch goals you’ll try for beyond that minimum. Push these updated goals to the repo.</li>
</ul>

<p>For next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Push a project preview (i.e. get something started) to your repository.</li>
  <li>Continue updating and following your group plan.</li>
  <li>Document your progress as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push.</li>

<!-- **NO CLASS or a SUB? This is the first day / second night of Passover.** -->

<p>For next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full-as-possible draft of consolidation project</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/plans/lesson-25">Lesson 25, <del>Thursday 4/9</del> Tuesday 4/14</a> – Workshop</h3>

<p>For next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set yourself some deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the last class (in two days!)? Will you continue beyond that for Sunday, knowing the final portfolio is due on Tuesday 4/21?</li>
  <li><strong>Read</strong> Paul Ford’s “Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes” from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). (<a href="http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684">Pitt Library link</a>)</li>
  <li>Ford writes, “I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>” <strong>Read back</strong> through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans. What things have you done this semester?</li>
  <li><strong>Choose</strong> something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unit-6">Unit VI: Reflection and Revision</h2>

<p><em>Before the semester ends, I’d wanted to set aside time to work on drafting a reflective introduction to your final portfolio. With the lost week, that ends up being… one day. Sigh. Given self-pacing, some of you may end up here sooner…?</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/plans/lesson-26">Lesson 26, <del>Tuesday 4/14</del> Thursday 4/16</a> – Last day of class! Looking back and looking forward</h3>

<!-- Asynchronous writing toward final portfolio reflection -->

<p>For next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finish consolidation project by Sunday, if you haven’t yet</li>
  <li>Work to complete your final portfolio (due Tuesday)</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<em>Final portfolios will be due by the end of the final exam slot, which we now know will be <strong>Tuesday, April 21 at 1:50pm</strong>.</em> Grades are due eight days later, so if you want to turn it in earlier (but not before 4/14, I would expect), feel free to do so.

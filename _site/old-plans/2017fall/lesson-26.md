### OMETs or working time

I'll leave the room for 10-15 minutes, either way. Let me know if you want me to come back earlier than that. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
Remember that these serve multiple purposes and go to multiple audiences:
<ul>
<li>The results go to the chair of my department, who can use it to decide whether to keep offering this course.</li>
<li>They also go to the Dean's office, and get put in my file toward tenure and promotion.</li>
<li>After grades are turned in, I get a copy and will use your comments to reflect on and improve my teaching.</li>
<li>If an ongoing fight within the university government is won, future students will be able to access the reports for the purpose of choosing classes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
So the OMETs are pretty important! You should have a link to the survey on the homepage of your CourseWeb account, or in your Pitt email.


EXT: If you haven't yet, please fill out the [Tech Comfort Survey](bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey) (end-of-term edition) for a comparison between now and the beginning of the semester. There's a new question in which you may give or withhold permission for me to give future students your work as an example for discussion of what's possible in CDM.

EXT: If you've done both of those things to your satisfaction and you're waiting for your classmates to finish, you can use this time for solo work on your portfolio / revisions or your final reflection.


### Final group presentations

Each group will have 10 minutes to share the awesome. This isn't a workshop, but rather a celebration, though if time allows we can have Q&A. 

So walk us through 
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>the thing you made,</li>
<li>how it's changed since we last saw it, and</li>
<li>what the fate of the project will be for the foreseeable future: 
    <ul>
        <li>will you keep it live?</li>
        <li>can others participate if they want?</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>


### Check in with the clock 

* if 45 or more minutes remain, ***group* up** (no more than 3 people per group) to share which projects you're planning to revise, and talk through past feedback and present strategy; 
* if 30-45 minutes remain, we'll ***pair* up** for the same;
* if less than 30 minutes remain, **work *solo***.
* when 7 minutes remain, I'll want to make some closing remarks.


I'll hold office hours next week, on Wednesday 2-4pm (and the same hours Thursday, though that's after our official deadline of 9:50am for this class).



## Toward an Ending

**Inputs**

* Read back through your work, this website, your revision histories, and think reflectively about the semester as a whole: What stays the same, and what changes, as you've moved from project to project and from medium to medium?
* Review the [guidelines for the final portfolio](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/documents/2017/11/final-portfolio-checklist-and-reflection-guidelines.docx), including the prompts for the final reflection.

**Outputs**

* The final portfolio is due, as a post to this WordPress site, at 9:50 am on Thursday, December 14th.

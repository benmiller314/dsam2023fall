## Sharing Skills, Setting Goals (take 2)

**Texts to have read**: 

* John Bresland's <a href="http://bresland.com/brevity.html">"On Writing for the Ear"</a> and Rob Rosenthal's <a href="https://transom.org/2017/sound-design-basics/">Sound Design Basics</a>
* tutorials toward your audio project and/or keeping track of it

**Work to have done**:

* **Record** at least one spoken track to begin working with, knowing you can revise, retake, dub in, change your mind, etc.
* **Take notes** about what kinds of other sounds you might want to add
* at least one new git commit per working session, with a meaningful commit message

### Group skills sharing (20 min)
This weekend, I'd asked you to be ready to share one thing you'd figured out for your sound project: how to do something in Audacity, most likely, or maybe how to find just the right sound using advanced search.

Since we ran out the clock for our grouptime last class, I want to start here.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Please get in your groups and show each other what you've figured out!
</div>
 
Remember, every time you get in groups, to figure out who's the *timekeeper*; who's the *historian*, taking lead on taking notes; and who's the *diplomat*, making sure participation is balanced. (Hint: Usually, the first person to ask who wants which role is the diplomat.) **Timekeepers, let's aim to move forward at 11:20** to save time for criteria-building.

 
* EXT: Further Group brainstorming
 * If you finish early, use the remaining time to think big picture with your groupmates. <strong>What text might you want to re-cast as audio? What kinds of sounds or music might you layer in, for what kind of tone?</strong>
 * Take turns, and use <em>active listening</em> – that is, say back the heart of what you hear, with a <strong>...?</strong> at the end – to open a space for your partners to clarify and expand.
 * It may be useful to use the terms from *Writer/Designer*: who is your *audience*? what's the *context*? do you have any additional *purpose* for your piece, apart from the general one in the prompt? what *authorial ethos* do you want to project? what does that suggest you use as a target *genre*?

### Quick review of the unit project assignment (3-5 min)
You already have my super-classy [soundwritten assignment prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-assignments/blob/master/audio/unit-2-prompt.mp3) (text version [here](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-assignments/blob/master/audio/audio_assignment_text.md)), but let's review the essentials:

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ul>
<li><strong>The goal</strong> is to produce a multilayered audio recording that re-mediates something you've previously written as a linguistic text.</li>
<li><strong>Related genres</strong> include podcasts, radio documentaries, poetry or fiction readings, and sound collage.</li>
<li><strong>The first draft</strong> is due in two days (Th 10/5), when we'll have workshop. The <strong>final draft</strong> is due two weeks from today (Th 10/17).</li>
<li><strong>The content</strong> is up to you, but may begin with an essay from a former class or a piece of creative writing or journalism you've written.
  <ul>
  <li><em>Parachute prompt:</em> If you can't think of anything of your own to use, even after brainstorming with me, try one of these options. But please **run it by me first,** as some of these options are significantly different from the default project above. </li>
  <li>Record your own version of one of [Aesop's fables](http://read.gov/aesop/001.html), which are in the public domain</li>
  <li>Remix some archival materials of other people speaking, as per [Erin Anderson](http://erinand.com/projects.html), if you have can demonstrate permission to do so</li>
  <li>Compose a new essay in the style of [This I Believe](http://thisibelieve.org/guidelines)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Building criteria (40 min total)
We'll start in groups here, then discuss as a full class. 

#### Group brainstorm (10 min)
To bring all our notes together while allowing for real-time collaboration, **use [this google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2017fall).** 

<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>Task:</strong>
Given the goals of the assignment and what you've been able to figure out so far about your particular project goals, how will we know if you've succeeded? What constitutes a minimum set of criteria for this assignment?

Beyond that minimum, what would be some <em>good</em> goals to strive for, even if not everyone should expect to achieve them?
</div>

Take 10 minutes in groups to make some lists.

If you're at a loss, might I suggest again turning to some of the terms in *W/D*?

<aside>
#### Analytical tools as generative heuristics (food for groupthought)

Remember that authors of <em>Writer/Designer</em> offered us a bunch of lenses to use when we examine any multimodal text:

<div class="cols-3">
<div class="float-left">
<strong>Modes</strong>
<ul>
<li>linguistic</li>
<li>visual</li>
<li>aural</li>
<li>spatial</li>
<li>gestural</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- /modes -->

<div class="float-left">
<strong>Rhetorical Situation</strong>
<ul>
<li>audience</li>
<li>purpose</li>
<li>context</li>
<li>author / ethos</li>
<li>genre</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /rhetorical-situation -->

<div class="float-left">
<strong>Design Elements</strong>
<ul>
<li>emphasis</li>
<li>contrast</li>
<li>organization</li>
<li>alignment</li>
<li>proximity</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /design-elements -->
</div> <!-- /.cols-3 -->

By asking yourself what you see when you put each lens up to your eye, you can begin to notice different features in a multimodal text. But you can also use those lenses to imagine what you might <em>want</em> to notice – what you might want <em>to build</em>.

Without getting caught up in trying every combination, play around with these terms and see what they suggest for criteria in the context of this unit, this project. 
</aside>

#### Let's talk! (30 min)
Quickly read through the other groups' notes, and as you see overlap, propose an official version for our list of shared criteria.

We'll refine as a group, and repeat. 

This process could probably take as much time as we can give it, but let's stop with 5 minutes left in class to make sure there's time for announcements. We'll be able to revise these after testing them out in workshop on Thursday.

### Before we end for the day

* Can I get 3-4 volunteers for workshop on Thursday?
* If you haven't yet, can you please quickly add me as a collaborator on your repository?


## For Next Time
* **Inputs**
 * **Find and watch** any tutorials you need to begin getting a handle on Audacity
 * **Review** the criteria we developed today, and be ready to propose amendments as needed
 
* **Outputs**
 * **If you're being workshopped**, come ready to project your project files on the big screen.
 * Everyone, **Save and commit** to git as you go, with meaningful commit messages saying what you've accomplished in that editing session
 * **Push to GitHub** at least once, so I know you're working
  * Include at least one mp3 of the current state of the project, so I can easily preview the current state of the project
  * Include your *.aup project file and *.au subdirectory, so I can try to clone and open, and so that you have a matched backup. If you're using git-lfs, it's easy.
  * If you couldn't get git-lfs working, use [Box](http://pitt.box.com) to share your large files (.aup, .au). But please still do use github to keep track of your progress. You can even add a link to your Box folder as a .txt file in your git repository!

## Intro to Audio

**Texts to have read**:

* Your own commit history; the shared guidelines in the [Google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2017fall); and any tutorials needed to finish your visual project

**Work to have done**:

* Complete and post to GitHub a final copy of your visual unit project – including a prose reflection.

### Share reflections and insights from image unit

Congratulations on finishing! (At least for now; you can still revise through the final portfolio.) I've seen a lot of great projects around this room, and a lot of progress in terms of comfort with this kind of composing.

Before we move beyond the still image, I want to ask: 

* what can this format do well? 
* what are its limitations? 

### Press play

What if we asked the same questions about **audio**? (For now, let's leave out moving images and focus on sound.) How do you expect your answers will differ?

#### Touring Audacity
I'll just show you the project file for what I just posted; then you can play around on your own, using your headphones.

Try recording audio from this room, or importing a file from a site like [CCMixter](http://dig.ccmixter.org/). 

After a while, we'll discuss:

* What does the tool make easy? hard? 
* What are the visuals trying to emphasize? What did you want to find, but found hard to locate instead?
* What's the same and what's different about this UI vs. GIMP? 

### EXT: Studio
Use any remaining time to experiment, think about sounds, or get a head start on the homework.


## For Next Time

* **Administrative**: 
 * Office hours are "back" to normal, which is to say Wednesdays 2-4.

* **Inputs**
 * **Read** the text of John Bresland's <a href="http://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/future-ex-buys-pajamas/">Future Ex Buys Pajamas, as it was published in the literary journal <em>Brevity</em>.
 * **Afterwards, listen** to how Bresland remediated that <a href="http://bresland.com/audio.html"same piece as an audio track</a>
 * **Listen** (and, I guess, watch) Ira Glass talk about the basic building blocks of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=322&v=5pFI9UuC_fc">storytelling for broadcast</a>

* **Outputs**
 * **Write** a brief reflection on the WordPress site, and put it in the Reflections category: what do you notice in putting these texts together? what does that make you wonder? 
 * **Begin thinking** about what piece you might have that could benefit from translation to audio.
 * **Bring** a couple of options to talk through with your groupmates

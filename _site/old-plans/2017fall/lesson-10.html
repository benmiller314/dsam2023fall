<h3 id="group-skills-sharing-20-min">Group skills sharing (20 min)</h3>
<p>This weekend, I’d asked you to be ready to share one thing you’d figured out for your sound project: how to do something in Audacity, most likely, or maybe how to find just the right sound using advanced search.</p>

<p>Since we ran out the clock for our grouptime last class, I want to start here.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Please get in your groups and show each other what you've figured out!
</div>

<p>Remember, every time you get in groups, to figure out who’s the <em>timekeeper</em>; who’s the <em>historian</em>, taking lead on taking notes; and who’s the <em>diplomat</em>, making sure participation is balanced. (Hint: Usually, the first person to ask who wants which role is the diplomat.) <strong>Timekeepers, let’s aim to move forward at 11:20</strong> to save time for criteria-building.</p>

<ul>
  <li>EXT: Further Group brainstorming</li>
  <li>If you finish early, use the remaining time to think big picture with your groupmates. <strong>What text might you want to re-cast as audio? What kinds of sounds or music might you layer in, for what kind of tone?</strong></li>
  <li>Take turns, and use <em>active listening</em> – that is, say back the heart of what you hear, with a <strong>…?</strong> at the end – to open a space for your partners to clarify and expand.</li>
  <li>It may be useful to use the terms from <em>Writer/Designer</em>: who is your <em>audience</em>? what’s the <em>context</em>? do you have any additional <em>purpose</em> for your piece, apart from the general one in the prompt? what <em>authorial ethos</em> do you want to project? what does that suggest you use as a target <em>genre</em>?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quick-review-of-the-unit-project-assignment-3-5-min">Quick review of the unit project assignment (3-5 min)</h3>
<p>You already have my super-classy <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-assignments/blob/master/audio/unit-2-prompt.mp3">soundwritten assignment prompt</a> (text version <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-assignments/blob/master/audio/audio_assignment_text.md">here</a>), but let’s review the essentials:</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ul>
<li><strong>The goal</strong> is to produce a multilayered audio recording that re-mediates something you've previously written as a linguistic text.</li>
<li><strong>Related genres</strong> include podcasts, radio documentaries, poetry or fiction readings, and sound collage.</li>
<li><strong>The first draft</strong> is due in two days (Th 10/5), when we'll have workshop. The <strong>final draft</strong> is due two weeks from today (Th 10/17).</li>
<li><strong>The content</strong> is up to you, but may begin with an essay from a former class or a piece of creative writing or journalism you've written.
  <ul>
  <li><em>Parachute prompt:</em> If you can't think of anything of your own to use, even after brainstorming with me, try one of these options. But please **run it by me first,** as some of these options are significantly different from the default project above. </li>
  <li>Record your own version of one of [Aesop's fables](http://read.gov/aesop/001.html), which are in the public domain</li>
  <li>Remix some archival materials of other people speaking, as per [Erin Anderson](http://erinand.com/projects.html), if you have can demonstrate permission to do so</li>
  <li>Compose a new essay in the style of [This I Believe](http://thisibelieve.org/guidelines)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="building-criteria-40-min-total">Building criteria (40 min total)</h3>
<p>We’ll start in groups here, then discuss as a full class.</p>

<h4 id="group-brainstorm-10-min">Group brainstorm (10 min)</h4>
<p>To bring all our notes together while allowing for real-time collaboration, <strong>use <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2017fall">this google doc</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>Task:</strong>
Given the goals of the assignment and what you've been able to figure out so far about your particular project goals, how will we know if you've succeeded? What constitutes a minimum set of criteria for this assignment?

Beyond that minimum, what would be some <em>good</em> goals to strive for, even if not everyone should expect to achieve them?
</div>

<p>Take 10 minutes in groups to make some lists.</p>

<p>If you’re at a loss, might I suggest again turning to some of the terms in <em>W/D</em>?</p>

<aside>
#### Analytical tools as generative heuristics (food for groupthought)

Remember that authors of <em>Writer/Designer</em> offered us a bunch of lenses to use when we examine any multimodal text:

<div class="cols-3">
<div class="float-left">
<strong>Modes</strong>
<ul>
<li>linguistic</li>
<li>visual</li>
<li>aural</li>
<li>spatial</li>
<li>gestural</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- /modes -->

<div class="float-left">
<strong>Rhetorical Situation</strong>
<ul>
<li>audience</li>
<li>purpose</li>
<li>context</li>
<li>author / ethos</li>
<li>genre</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /rhetorical-situation -->

<div class="float-left">
<strong>Design Elements</strong>
<ul>
<li>emphasis</li>
<li>contrast</li>
<li>organization</li>
<li>alignment</li>
<li>proximity</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /design-elements -->
</div> <!-- /.cols-3 -->

By asking yourself what you see when you put each lens up to your eye, you can begin to notice different features in a multimodal text. But you can also use those lenses to imagine what you might <em>want</em> to notice – what you might want <em>to build</em>.

Without getting caught up in trying every combination, play around with these terms and see what they suggest for criteria in the context of this unit, this project. 
</aside>

<h4 id="lets-talk-30-min">Let’s talk! (30 min)</h4>
<p>Quickly read through the other groups’ notes, and as you see overlap, propose an official version for our list of shared criteria.</p>

<p>We’ll refine as a group, and repeat.</p>

<p>This process could probably take as much time as we can give it, but let’s stop with 5 minutes left in class to make sure there’s time for announcements. We’ll be able to revise these after testing them out in workshop on Thursday.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-end-for-the-day">Before we end for the day</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Can I get 3-4 volunteers for workshop on Thursday?</li>
  <li>If you haven’t yet, can you please quickly add me as a collaborator on your repository?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-next-time">For Next Time</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inputs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Find and watch</strong> any tutorials you need to begin getting a handle on Audacity</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Review</strong> the criteria we developed today, and be ready to propose amendments as needed</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Outputs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If you’re being workshopped</strong>, come ready to project your project files on the big screen.</li>
  <li>Everyone, <strong>Save and commit</strong> to git as you go, with meaningful commit messages saying what you’ve accomplished in that editing session</li>
  <li><strong>Push to GitHub</strong> at least once, so I know you’re working</li>
  <li>Include at least one mp3 of the current state of the project, so I can easily preview the current state of the project</li>
  <li>Include your *.aup project file and *.au subdirectory, so I can try to clone and open, and so that you have a matched backup. If you’re using git-lfs, it’s easy.</li>
  <li>If you couldn’t get git-lfs working, use <a href="http://pitt.box.com">Box</a> to share your large files (.aup, .au). But please still do use github to keep track of your progress. You can even add a link to your Box folder as a .txt file in your git repository!</li>
</ul>

### Quick Group Check-ins



### Work in Progress Presentations (WIPP)

As forewarned, groups that haven't yet presented will be asked to do a WIPP, with students who haven't yet been workshopped taking on a speaking role.

This is similar to the day we workshopped pitch websites, with a mix of ideas and design elements, but now inflected through the project proposal: 

* *Presenters* should **update us on the project goals and overall work plan**, then **share some designed composition-in-progress** they'd like feedback on.
 - If you haven't previously presented your work for class feedback, please do expect to speak as part of your WIPP.
* *The rest of us* will then offer responses that **describe** features or aspects of the composition, **evaluate** their effectiveness in terms of the goals, and **suggest** possible ways to improve their effectiveness.


We'll begin with Alyssa and Jack, for [@pghmornings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3olRG0cK9Vwak84xnEplhwQhUmhQ2zfoXiLXn2xV7A/edit?ts=5a01e148), taking 5 minutes or so to present, and 10-15 for discussion.

Next up will be [foodguidepgh](http://wp.majoringinmeta.net/foodguidepgh/), where Abby, Caleb, Jeff, and Jojo can decide amongst themselves which two will present first.

EXT: I want to check in with the clock. If it's after 11:30, let's have more WIPPs on Thursday, and move now into group time. If it's just 11:30 now, let's hear from one more group.



### Group Time

Do what's needful for your projects, bearing in mind the "before you leave" request below.

I'll float; call me over as needed.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Some tips and EXTs: 

<ol>
<li>Have a look at the checklist and sets of questions in <em>Writer/Designer</em> chapter 7 (110-112) for some revision considerations. Some are matters of final polish, but some are essentials. Discuss with your groupmates which is which.</li>

<li>Look back at the schedule you set for yourselves in the group contract. Knowing what you know now, would you leave that schedule as-is, or would you adjust it? If the latter, what would be a more reasonable schedule for the next time you try to collaborate on a project like this? Jot some notes you might consult for your final portfolio reflection. </li>
</ol>
</div>


### Before you leave

<div class="alert alert-success">
I'd like each group to again please <strong>write me a quick email updating me on today's progress, and your updated task goals for before next class.</strong> CC everyone in the group, so you have a record.
</div>

Note: if you're using an issue / task queue, whether on GitHub or elsewhere, you can also send an email pointing me to that.



## For next time

**Administrative**

* Next class will be another workshop / studio day. If you haven't yet presented your work for class feedback, plan to give a WIPP.
* I do have a handout on preparing the final portfolio; we can talk about it next class.


**Inputs**

* If you haven't yet, please skim through *Writer/Designer* chapter 8, on "Putting Your Project to Work." It deals with preparations for delivery and the "multimodal afterlife," as well as documentation. 
 - Consider: what would someone else need to know, or need access to, if they wanted to pick up your project and run with it after the semester ended?
* Continue gathering whatever materials or tutorials you'll need to complete your own tasks on your group project.
<!-- Reread your proposal: what are the criteria by which you'll know you were successful? Be ready to refer to these criteria in your presentation / reflection on the project -->

**Outputs**

* Email me with any requests for minilessons or insights from my own work with (e.g.) WordPress, especially if you can't find or are having trouble interpreting a tutorial or documentation page.
* Check off some checklist items on your group to-do list! <!-- Aim to have at least a complete rough cut: not just a mock up, but all the pieces in the actual platform, ready to revise. -->

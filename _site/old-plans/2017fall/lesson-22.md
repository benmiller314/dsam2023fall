### Work in Progress Presentation (WIPP)

Sammie and Eli graciously agreed to present the work that they have so far. This is similar to the day we workshopped pitch websites, with a mix of ideas and design elements, but now inflected through the project proposal: 

* *Presenters* should **update us on the project goals and overall work plan**, then **share some designed composition-in-progress** they'd like feedback on.
 - If you haven't previously presented your work for class feedback, please do expect to speak as part of your WIPP.
* *The rest of us* will then offer responses that **describe** features or aspects of the composition, **evaluate** their effectiveness in terms of the goals, and **suggest** possible ways to improve their effectiveness.


### Group Time

Do what's needful for your projects, bearing in mind the "before you leave" request below.

I'll float; call me over as needed.



### Before you leave

I'd like each group to please write me a quick email updating me on today's progress, and your updated task goals for before next class. CC everyone in the group, so you have a record.

Note: if you're using an issue / task queue, whether on GitHub or elsewhere, you can also send an email pointing me to that.



## For next time

**Administrative**
<div class="alert alert-danger">
Our class won't meet next week, because of Thanksgiving and related matters and energies. I will have access to email, but some responses may be delayed.
</div>

* The Tuesday when we get back will be another workshop day. If you haven't yet presented your work for class feedback, plan to give a WIPP.


**Inputs**

* If you haven't yet, please skim through *Writer/Designer* chapter 6, on "Designing Your Project." It deals with mock-ups and storyboards. Consider: which of these drafting modes is most suited to your project?
* Continue gathering whatever materials or tutorials you'll need to complete your own tasks on your group project.

**Outputs**

* Email me with any requests for minilessons or insights from my own work with (e.g.) WordPress, especially if you can't find or are having trouble interpreting a tutorial or documentation page.
* Check off some checklist items on your group to-do list! 
 - Note that if you're using GitHub [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and/or [Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management) to manage your task list, you can literally check a box. Plus, it'll keep track of the history of when that happened, and who can take credit. (Not all task management software can say that.)

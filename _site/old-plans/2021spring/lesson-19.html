<p><strong>Work to have done</strong> (by Tuesday, but with catch-up as needed):</p>

<ul>
  <li>As much of the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">Interneting is Hard</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201105195453/https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">(but at least it’s WebArchive crawled)</a> tutorial as you can – at least parts 1-6 (from “Introduction” through “CSS Selectors”)</li>
  <li>More on CSS selectors: the <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> game and/or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/">a CSS-Tricks roundup</a></li>
  <li>A website proposal, posted to the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/">Issue Queue</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Brief intro to GitHub Pages</li>
  <li>Reminder of needful things from last time</li>
  <li>Set goals and go forth!</li>
  <li>Update your goals</li>
  <li>HW: first preview due Tuesday</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="0-warm-up-conversation">0. Warm-up conversation</h2>

<p>What did you guys think of the CSS Diner?</p>

<h2 id="1-brief-intro-to-github-pages">1. Brief intro to GitHub Pages</h2>

<h3 id="what-it-is">What it is</h3>
<p>In addition to the wonderful things we’ve already used GitHub for, like forking, cloud storage, and peer comments on commits, GH also lets you make a fully functional basic website – open to the public and everything – for free. They call it GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works: you store your files in a GitHub repository (in a branch called “gh-pages,” like I do for this site, or a subdirectory called “docs” – look in your own repos!), and GH knows where to find your stuff.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h3>

<p>To activate GH Pages,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to your repository Settings</li>
  <li>Scroll down to where it says “GitHub Pages”</li>
  <li>Change the source from “none” to “master”</li>
  <li>Change the folder from “/ (root)” to “/docs”</li>
  <li>Click “save.”</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s it! The settings should now show you the URL where your rendered HTML will appear. If it doesn’t, just wait and/or try again; sometimes it takes a minute or two to refresh.</p>

<figure role="figure"><figcaption>Here’s a visual representation of those instructions.</figcaption> <img src="../assets/img/github--activate-gh-pages.gif" alt="screencast enacting the ordered list above" />.</figure>

<h3 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
One important caveat: <em>By default, it'll show your README.md file as the home page, unless it finds a file called index.html or index.md</em>.
</div>

<p>Therefore, rather than call your landing page myproject.html, landing.html, or home.html, you’re better off if you <strong>name your homepage <em>index.html</em></strong>. You can always change the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> to give it a more accurate name in the browser tab. : )</p>

<p>In addition, you should be aware that GH Pages takes a little time to render your latest changes. For faster feedback on the changes you make, you’ll want to <strong>view the local file in your browser</strong>, rather than always waiting for the live site to load.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re feeling confident about code and want to make it less repetitive, GH Pages comes with the Jekyll templating engine built in. Setup for local development with Jekyll is a little more involved (it requires the command line and Ruby), but the documentation is pretty good. You can read more about it, and find a series of relevant links, on our <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/resources#web-frameworks:~:text=Jekyll%20step%2Dby%2Dstep">Resources page</a>, at the end of the section on <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/resources#web-frameworks">Web Frameworks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<div class="alert alert-success">
I'm going to recommend that everyone use GitHub Pages to publish your sites unless you have a good reason not to. (And you might! But talk to me about it.)
</div>

<h2 id="2-reminder-of-needful-things-from-last-time">2. Reminder of needful things from last time</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Beware of scope creep; plan for phased releases.</li>
  <li>Start by thinking about structure (i.e. HTML before CSS).</li>
  <li>You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.</li>
  <li>When you’re ready to work on appearances, test CSS rules directly in the browser.
    <ul>
      <li>Be sure to <strong>copy your changes to your text editor for safe keeping</strong> (i.e. Atom, by default), <strong>or they’ll disappear when you refresh!</strong></li>
      <li>To make copy/paste easier, click on the source your browser created for your new rules: in Firefox it’s called “inline”, in Chrome “inspector-stylesheet”, in Safari “Inspector Stylesheet.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- a series of screenshots here would be nice, wouldn't it? -->

<p>If you want a refresher on what any of those things mean, you can find more detail in <a href="lesson-18">Tuesday’s lesson plan</a>. I also had these pieces of general advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for semanticity.</li>
  <li>Let appearances reflect the structure, not vice-versa.</li>
  <li>If you’re stuck for what to do, CSS-wise, start with some basic spacing.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes">Web Design in 4 Minutes</a> suggests what some of those basics might be.</li>
      <li>For more advanced layout (sidebars, columns, grids, etc), see the links in the homework assignment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- FOR NEXT LESSON, not today

## 2. Other notes


* Take on the lowest line-count challenge. Ask yourself:
  - does that div need to be there?
  - could those CSS rules be combined?


  <details>
  <summary>Take advantage of parent selectors and classes to limit the scope of CSS rules</summary>
  <p>If you're worried a rule will spread too broadly, e.g. affecting inner page <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s when you only meant it to apply on the front page, just limit the scope of the css rule by specifying a class, or a parent container, or both. For example, the following code will only apply to <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s inside a <code>&lt;body class="front"&gt;</code>:
  <pre><code class="css">
  body.front h2 {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
  </code></pre>
  (Setting a class on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is a good way to set up page-wide contexts, e.g. for background or the position of a navigation bar.)
  </p>
  <p>
  Or here's code that only applies to an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> when it appears inside an element (a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, say, or a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>) with class "title-block":
  <pre><code class="css">
  .title-block h2 {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
  </code></pre>
  This solution probably makes the most sense if you want to do some styling on the containing element, like changing its background or centering a bunch of things.
  </p>
  <p>
  Or – probably the simplest solution of all – you could just set the class directly on the element, calling it something like "subtitle" (or whatever you want to call it): <pre><code class="html">&lt;h2 class="subtitle"&gt;</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="css">
  h2.subtitle {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
  </code></pre>

  This has the extra advantage that you can set a lot of other rules for <em>all</em> <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s, and just add the tweaks you need for the subtitle in this additional ruleset. In other words: the Cascading Style Sheet will cascade!
  </p>

<h2 id="3-go-forth">3. Go forth!</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes">shared google doc</a>, <strong>set a goal for today</strong>: what do you need to do to level up on HTML, CSS, and resource gathering to move toward your specific project? Note that a Website Preview is due on Tuesday, but the Website Draft isn’t due until a full week after that. (I’m suggesting that you work on getting some content into HTML by Tuesday, and a starter layout into place by Thursday, April 1st.)</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you haven't yet, please do expand and read the notes from last class. Also remember that you have many <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/resources#web-design">Resources</a> on our website; for today, might I especially point out the <strong>design advantages of <a href="https://loremipsum.io">placeholder text</a> and/or <a href="https://loremipsum.io/21-of-the-best-placeholder-image-generators/">images</a></strong>?
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
As usual, to get credit for asynchronous participation, please add your intentions and exit notes to the google doc when you start and stop working – and aim to work for at least two 20-minute pomodoros. <!-- (In class, we had about 50 minutes of straight-up studio time.) --> It helps me if you flag this as a suggestion or comment, so I get an email alert, but you can also just send an update email to me directly. : )
</div>

<p>Save about five minutes at the end to write me a brief exit note about what you’ve been working on.</p>

<h2 id="4-exit-note">4. Exit note</h2>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave, just as a way for me to check in, I'd like to hear more about what happened today: Did you decide on your navigation? Block out the html? Make some progress on a stylesheet? Work through a tutorial or two (and which)?

<strong>Reply to your note in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes">google doc</a>.</strong>
</div>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do</strong> more of the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">tutorial</a>, including at least Flexbox (8) and Responsive Design (10), if you haven’t yet. (Broken record reminder: you can skip Floats.)
    <ul>
      <li>As a reminder, you should <strong>write out the exercises in the tutorials</strong> and push them to your repository – probably in the tutorials subfolder. That helps me know where I can be more helpful, especially if things are starting to go sideways.</li>
      <li>Once you have the tutorial sample code working as presented, by all means update the pages to test out ideas for your own site! But <em>do try to confirm you can get them working first.</em> HTML, like all code, is fiddly: punctuation (including spaces) matters for things like close-tags and CSS selectors.</li>
      <li>It might help to keep the tutorial files as written in the tutorials subfolder of your repo, and then save the duplicated-and-modified versions in your docs folder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Separately, also <strong>read about <a href="https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-layout-crossed-sections-fca9e956e725">Grid Layout</a></strong> (and optionally the followup post on <a href="https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f">responsive grid</a>).
    <ul>
      <li>If you want to practice with this code, go for it! Just create a new folder in your tutorials subfolder.</li>
      <li>EXT: Want more CSS Grid templates and examples, including CodePens to play with? Try <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/learn/">Grid By Example</a>, which also has video tutorials (in a charming British accent, if you find that sort of thing charming).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Compose and push</strong> a first website preview: a beginning, focused on content and navigation.</li>
</ul>

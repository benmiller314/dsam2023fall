<div class="footnote-block">with a hat tip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Finality">Community</a></div>

**Work to have done**: Submit final-for-now website, with source files, and [reflection]({{site.github.issues_url}}) (turning in by midnight is also okay)

**Plan for the Day**:

1. Creative writing as a tool for critical thinking (15 min)<!-- metaphors for learning -->
2. Final Portfolio Preview and Consolidation Unit Goals (10-15 min)
3. Generative Writing and Self-Assessment (15 min) <!-- and self-assessment -->
4. Studio time: website or a new proposal (30 min)


## 1. Creative writing as a tool for critical thinking (15 min)

Congratulations on reaching the end of the web unit! The unit reflection is due tonight at 11:59pm; I know some of you have already finished it.

Whether you have or not, I'd like you to take a few minutes to think about the process of composing this way, and of _learning_ to compose this way. And I'd like you to get loose and have a little fun with that thinking, so I'll ask you to use **metaphor** (or, more specifically, simile): to read your learning, or your composing, as something else entirely.

To wit:

### Generate comparisons (3-5 min)
<div class="alert alert-success">
   <ol class="spaced">
      <li><strong>What was it <em>like</em> to compose a website?</strong> To what other activities might you compare it? <ul class="spaced"><li>For example, was it like getting butterflies to fly in formation? (That metaphor is Betsy Sargent's, I can't take credit for it.) Was it like writing on loose paper with a pen that's chained in a dark room? Like singing and humming at the same time?</li></ul> Let your mind wander for a minute, and see what comes to mind when you start off thinking about the <em>process</em> of working with html, css, etc.</li>
      <li>Would you use the same metaphor for the other kinds of digital composing you've used this semester? If not, what other metaphor would you propose?</li>
   </ol>
</div>

Take 3-5 minutes to think in writing through the questions above. Then I'm going to ask you to **share in your small groups, working to answer a third question:**

### Use comparisons as leverage (5 min)

<div class="alert alert-success">
<ol start="3"><li><em>Within the metaphors</em> you've come up with, what strategies would help you continue improving? What strategies might that suggest in real life, i.e. outside of the metaphor?</li></ol>
</div>

I won't collect this, but I will ask for some volunteers to share when we get back from groups... and I suggest that you return to these when writing your end-of-semester reflection.

EXT: If you're waiting for the rest of us, consider: what personal skillsets do you feel like you now possess, that you might offer to a team of digital media composers?

### Share and enjoy (5 min)

Any volunteers? Any insights? Any questions?

## 2. Final Portfolio Preview and Consolidation Unit Goals (10-15 min)

The final portfolio for the course is due in just two weeks (¡...!), on Tuesday, April 27. (That's our exam slot, which nominally runs from 12pm-1:50pm.)

### Portfolio contents

As we have for each individual unit, for the final portfolio I’m asking you to write reflectively about the course and your work in it, crystalizing what you’ve learned – and how you will go on learning – about composing digital media.

<div class="alert alert-white">
The final portfolio itself will consist of a single post on the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a> (thread coming soon), containing:

<ul>
  <li>a <strong>prose reflection</strong> of at least 800-1200 words (1200-1800 recommended), reflecting on the course and framing the portfolio’s contents in terms of your learning and goals;</li>
  <li><strong>representative thumbnails, hyperlinked to final rendered versions</strong> of your four unit projects, i.e. Soundscape Narrative (.mp3), Visual Argument (.png), Website (live url or index.html), and Consolidation (tbd);</li>
  <li><strong>links to your repositories</strong> (on either GitHub or Box) for each of those pieces; and</li>
  <li><strong>a thumbnail image of at least one specific prior draft, hyperlinked to that draft's commit in the revision history</strong>, allowing you to talk about your revision skills.</li>
</ul>
</div>

As with previous reflections, I encourage you to include these screenshots and thumbnails wherever they make the most sense, rather than feeling like they need to be segregated from the rest of your thoughts.

### Consolidation / integration unit

Rather than draw out your reflection for as long as possible, I'm hoping you'll be able to use these last two weeks to help digest and apply what you've learned over the last 12 weeks. As I put it in the [schedule](../schedule),

<blockquote>In this final unit I’ll ask you to build on what you’ve already made: <strong>a revision, an extension, or a combination,</strong> of the modes and media you used in earlier units.</blockquote>


The unit goals, then, are:
<!-- 1. to practice managing a complex project involving multiple team members -->
1. to integrate and consolidate the skills you've practiced across the semester
2. to assess your own skills as a digital media composer, to find ways _you_ in particular might best contribute to a collaborative digital project (perhaps in the future)


<!-- At this point, here's what I wanted:
## 3. Brainstorming / self-assessment (5-10 min)

First, I'd like you to think about goal two, above. Consider the following roles:

1. project manager (organize schedule, keep everyone on task)
3. visual designer (plan layout and execute visual hierarchy)
4. experience designer (plan interactivity, spatiality, sequence)
2. programmer (get into the weeds of code)
5. researcher (find materials and assets, quickly grasp tutorials)
6. copy writer (produce public-ready prose)

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take some notes:
<ul><li>Where do you see your strengths, within these categories?</li>
<li>Where are you on the cusp of leveling up?</li>
<li>Where would you like more help from a teammate?</li>
</ul>

EXT: Do you have a specific project idea you'd like to explore? Jot down some notes now.
</div>

## 4. Marketplace of ideas (forming groups)
I don't have a particular strategy for group formation today, other than to let you sort it out!

That said, you should have between 2 and 4 people per group.

You don't have to have every role above represented, but it would probably be good to diversify your skillset where possible.


5. Group proposal in writing, with goals and roles
Download the file ["group-proposal.md"](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/blob/gh-pages/uploads/group-proposal.md): from that link, you can right-click the "Raw" button and Save Link As.

Then, working as a group, follow the instructions in the file.

You may also want to look at [this excerpt from _Writer/Designer_](https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye), on ways to facilitate group collaboration.


THANKS FOR NOTHING, COVID-19!

### What might that look like?

On the most straightforward level, this could literally be a **revision of one of your existing projects.** Were there stretch goals or aspirations that you think you didn't quite figure out how to achieve? Did you write in a reflection about what you might do with more time? Well, now you have a little more time! We might call this a baseline option, though of course excellent work is still worth rewarding.

Another, more ambitious option would be to make a **_second_ project in the vein of one you've already done**: another sound-editing project, another visual argument, another website. You'll have less time than you did originally, but you should also be higher on the learning curve. In this same vein, you could try an alternate program for the same genres: e.g. AdobeSuite parallels like Audition (for Audacity) and Photoshop (for GIMP) – or vice versa, if you started with Adobe. See what happens when you dive in again, and reflect on the differences!

A third, also aspirational, option is to build a **new project that builds on what you know to make something different**: e.g. you could try or next-level tools like [Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa6a7oz7vEE) for vector graphics (the Adobe parallel is Illustrator) or Ableton for music mixing (there's a [free trial](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/)); or try for one of the ideas you'd already [proposed on the Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22paying+forward%22), like a comic, a zine, a narrative with audio and image (you might look into Twine<a id="ftnref1" href="#ftn1" class="ftnref">[1]</a>), or a flipbook-style animation, any of which might be a collaboration that represents all its members in its pages.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Note that while I'm not requiring you to work in groups, I'm not requiring you to work solo: if you have a team that can collaborate effectively in online formats (via Zoom, Discord, Slack, what-have-you), you're welcome to go for it!</p>

<p>If you are thinking of going the group route, let me know, so I can give advice re: team roles and workflows for shared repositories. (You may also want to read <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/96l347yyrx2e69lkx635bl0jac4beaye">this excerpt from <em>Writer/Designer</em></a>, on more general strategies for communication for cooperation during collaboration. Some good information!)</p>

<!--
; or – and this is what I was originally going to suggest for anyone not sure what to make or do here, though time is tight this semester – you could make a Twine.


What is <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>?


<figure>
<a href="http://twinery.org/" title="link to Twine homepage"><img src="../assets/img/twine--official-description.png" alt="Twine is 'an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories,' to quote their website. Follow link for complete text." /></a>
</figure>



**I've recorded a roughly [10-minute screencast intro to Twine](https://pitt.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44615ce9-c3cf-4834-b479-ab920021d354) and why I think it's useful now**, which you can check out later if you're intrigued. But in a nutshell, it allows you to apply your knowledge of html and css, and the affordances of sound and/or image, in a shared context that's also pretty fun. A choose-your-own-adventure story is one way to think about it. But it's not always adventure, not always a story... and not even always choice. <!-- And many of you did say you wanted to build games! -->

<!--
<details><summary>Click for examples and resources on Twine.</summary>

Here are some examples, grouped more or less in pairs of shorter (odds) and longer (evens). To get a feel for how Twine works, and the range of possibilities, I suggest you **open and play through at least one of each, or through the beginning few scenes, until you get the flavor.** Note that the first four are more or less professional-level, while the last two were made by students at Pitt.

1. [The Tiniest Room](https://erik108.itch.io/the-tiniest-room) - a minimalist escape room
2. [The Griffin and the Minor Canon](https://cmg.itch.io/the-griffin-and-the-minor-canon) - more poetic (it's actually an adaptation of a [short story](https://www.classicshorts.com/stories/griffin.html) from 1885). Hint: if you're stuck, visit the stone ledge a few times. The view isn't always the same.
3. [Queers in Love at the End of the World](https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world) - what will you do with the short time you have left?
4. [the uncle who works for nintendo](https://ztul.itch.io/the-uncle-who-works-for-nintendo) – a horror game; see trigger warning link on home screen.
5. [Conquering Cathy](http://philome.la/mtyrhetoric/conquering-cathy/play) - "A trial of fortitude & vitality at the University of Pittsburgh"
6. [Remnants](https://philome.la/lissamay/remnants-by-kelly-sung/play/index.html) – Your mother is crying next to your bed. Why can't you touch her hand?


If this sounds intriguing, I encourage you to look at the <a href="../resources#twine--interactive-narrative">relevant section of our course resources page</a> for links to the Twine and Harlowe wikis (your basic starting point) and some good video tutorials (listed as a "slightly more advanced intro").

-->

<!-- * Screencast: introduce the genre by showing the opening sequences of some (polished/published) games
  - When you first download the Twine app, it may tell you the file "can't be opened because it's from an unknown developer." Not to worry: just right-click the executable, and choose Open from the context menu. Instead of rejecting the program outright, it'll just give you warning but still let you Open Anyway.
  * Show how you can import an existing game and see how it works
  * Walk through the basic features, show how easy it is to do basics
  * Show the Harlowe wiki and the cookbook
  * Link to the Harlowe wiki and the cookbok
  * Link to some additional student examples -->

## And now, studio time.
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>A proposal / plan for your consolidation unit is due by the end of Thursday's class.</strong> If you're working in a group, one proposal per group is fine (but do say who the group members are... and, ideally, how you'd like to divide up the work.) See below for some questions to think through.</p>

<p>That said, if you're still finalizing your website, you can use this time to do that work – and to ask questions, while I'm available to help.</p>
</div>

Use the [shared google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.f0sh5csl9d1b) to state your goals for the working session, and come back to add an exit note at 4:00, as usual.

### Generative writing

If you're planning for the consolidation/integration project, I suggest you **start by working through the prompts below.** Use my recording to async this process; it'll take about 15 minutes.

*(This exercise adapted from Sondra Perl's [Guidelines for Composing](http://bit.ly/perlfeltsense))*  <!-- Record this in Audacity?? -->

<div class="alert alert-warning">

<figure role="figure">
    <figcaption>For an audio version of the text-based writing prompts that follow, you can use this media player:</figcaption>
    <audio
        controls
        src="../assets/sound/ben-reads-perl-guidelines--final-unit.mp3">
            Your browser does not support the
            <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
    <figcaption>It has a runtime of 14 minutes, 35 seconds.</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

Take a breath. Close your eyes. Put down your pen, or take your hands off your keyboard. Find a way to be present to yourself, wherever you are, and know that **whatever you write for the next set of questions will not be collected:** it's for you alone.

1. Start by making a list: What's on my mind? what have I been meaning to do lately? When you feel yourself answering, begin to write.

2. Set that list aside – it'll wait for you until you've finished here – and ask yourself again: What skills have I been building in this class? What do I feel I've leveled up on, or that I'm on the verge of leveling up on? What am I on the edge of accomplishing? As before, just make a list, like an inventory: don't delve too much into any one item.

3. Now ask yourself: Is there anything I've been trying to do in this class, but haven't yet done? Any aspirational goals I meant to achieve, but just ran out of time for? Did any of the ideas above sound both fun and achievable, a way to make these last couple of weeks more celebratory than stressful? Again, take a quick survey; you'll have time later to expand.

4. Take one more moment to consider: Is there anything I'm forgetting, that could go on this list? If you came to this exercise with a project already in mind, make sure to add that to your list.

Take a moment now to read back over your lists. Is there something that stands out, that says, _me, pick me_? Choose one thing to work with, at least for today, and mark it in some way. Then copy it into a clean page.

With that chosen subject, write again:

5. What terms or images come to mind when you think of this subject? ... Think about categories of words: actions vs things. Descriptors (adjectives).
6. Is there anything you're forgetting to add to your list? A line from a song? A color?
7. Who else might be interested in this? Who, that is, could be your audience?

See if you can summon up the whole of this idea, like it's right here in the room with you. Where does it live? Is it above you? Inside you? In the palm of your hand? Just sit with your idea for a moment, feeling where you connect to it.

### From processing to proposing

Now that you've spent some time discovering your thoughts for yourself, it's time to share them with others – and, possibly, to recruit some likeminded co-travelers.

Taking public notes now in the [google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.cuikuo88l7n2), **work your way toward developing a task list for your project**:

* What are the parts of the project?
* What assets will you need to find?
* What do you already know how to do, and what will you need to learn?
* Would some tasks be easier to outsource or split with a partner, and if so, who might you ask to partner with you?

<div class="alert alert-success">
If you'd like me to set up breakout rooms to talk as a group, let me know! I'm happy to do so.
</div>

EXT: If you have time now, you can get started on implementing your plan. We'll have mostly studio time for the next three classes. (Next Tuesday, if possible, we'll try to gather some shared baseline criteria toward achieving the unit goals that might work for all the projects. So aim to have started *something* by then.)


## Exit notes

By the time 5 minutes remain in class, please come back to the plan you wrote at the beginning of studio time and update it with your progress and/or plans for next steps.


# Homework for next time

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>If you haven't yet finished your website project, start there.</strong> You could even save the Ford reading for the weekend, in that case.</p>

<p>The project proposal would be great to have in place by next class, so you can make the most of studio time, but we can be flexible through the end of this week – especially if you're still waist-deep in the website and need a minute to breathe and get your bearings again.</p>
</div>

* *Preparing for the final portfolio:*
  * **Read** Paul Ford's short "Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes" from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019).

  * Ford writes, "I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>" **Read back** through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects. Skim through the lesson plans. What things have you done this semester?
  * **Choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you.

* *Preparing one final project or revision:*
  * _By the end of next class_, you should decide (together, if working on a team) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project for the consolidation/integration unit, and what series of stretch goals you'll try for beyond that minimum.
  * When you're ready, make a new repository (GH, Box, or Drive)<a id="ftnref2" href="#ftn2" class="ftn">[2]</a> that all members of your team can [edit](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-digital-affordances#i-make-a-copy-you-can-edit), containing:
    - a brief overview of your project  goals
    - a task list for your project
    - proposed roles for your team members, if you have a team of more than one
  * Post your project proposal, with a link to the repository, on the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}).

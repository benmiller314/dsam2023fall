# Sound Unit Workshop

**Work to have done**: a solid attempt at a complete soundscape narrative, ideally meeting <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.tq2fxvj4mi89">baseline criteria</a>. Rough edges are still welcome.

**Plan for the day**:

1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
3. Peer review workshop (3 times 10-12 min); EXT: Studio
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW preview



## 0. Warm-up writing
Think about writing you've had reviewed before, whether by peers or by teachers. What were the best, most helpful responses? What were the worst, least helpful responses? What could you do to make responses that _you_ give less like the worst, and more like the best?

## 1. Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)

Today is all about getting _feedback_ for your projects. What does that metaphor mean? It's a process by which the output is picked up again as input. You've brought in your output so far; now you're going to learn by getting input from your audience.

<!-- A lot of peer review fails because it falls to one of two extremes: noncommittal nods, or non-stop nitpicking. Neither really takes advantage of the output we have in front of us. -->

To avoid some of the potential pitfalls of peer review, I'm going to insist that you provide this feedback in three steps:
<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you hear, <em>without judging whether it's good or not</em>. What is this project? What do you think is happening? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- A lot of times as writers, even soundwriters, we don't even know if our audience is getting the main point we want to get across. This is a way of finding out. --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to our shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. NB: This is still a form of description.<!-- It's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose your comments as a suggestion, not a command: and interpret comments you receive as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

### We can't trade cards, so we'll trade clones

In an in-person semester, I'd ask you to fit your comments on index cards; that should give you a sense of how much writing I'm expecting here. (Ie, it should be relatively focused.) Since we can't do cards, you'll **download three repositories, as specified below,** and write your feedback for the authors _on GitHub_.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you have more than one Audacity project in your repo, to make this process easier, you should probably indicate in your README.md file where to find the main .aup file for your project.
</div>


## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
We set up [a few shared goals and constraints](http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.tq2fxvj4mi89) that meet the baseline requirements. Let's try to help everyone get at least to there!

<details><summary><a title="as of Friday 2021-02-05">Baseline Requirements</a></summary>
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit <em>must</em>...

<ul>
  <li>Play for at least two minutes (and no more than five)</li>
  <li>Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you</li>
  <li>Explore simultaneity of sound by having two or more tracks overlap at least once</li>
  <li>Have something change during the piece, even if it loops back to where it started</li>
  <li>Credit your sources with title, creator, location, and permission; for clarity, credit yourself as well (e.g. “all other sounds recorded by me”)</li>
  <li>Signal an intentional ending (or that the piece loops)</li>
  <li>Meet deadlines and requirements from the assignment prompt (reflection, project title, playable mp3)</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary><a title="as of Friday 2021-02-05">Aspirational Inspirations</a></summary>
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit <em>may</em>...
<ul>
  <li>Use background tracks (e.g. music, ambient noise) to convey a consistent narrative/emotional tone</li>
  <li>Use background tracks (e.g. music, ambient noise) to convey a climax or shift in narrative/emotional tone</li>
  <li>Create a sense of 3D environment using panning, volume, filters, etc</li>
  <li>Use enough detail, perhaps in overlapping tracks, to convey a sense of a specific place and time (i.e. other than where the listener is)</li>
  <li>Use enough minimalism to convey a sense that the narrative is located where the listener is</li>
  <li>Demonstrate (e.g. in workshop notes or similar feedback) that listeners understand the soundscape narrative as intended</li>
  <li>Have dialogue or monologue drive the story and/or give it structure</li>
  <li>Convey a narrative without using any human voices</li>
  <li>Extend your depth of knowledge with the software (Audacity or git / GitHub) by using features that are new to you</li>
  <li>Try being a Foley artist: record your own sound effects, substituting available materials for unavailable ones (e.g. pouring beads for rain, compressing flour for walking through snow)</li>
  <li>Practice high-level editing through well-aligned transitions and loops, cuts at zero crossings, etc.</li>
  <li>Organize your files through track labeling, filenames, folder structure, etc</li>
  <li>Use meaningful commit messages</li>
</ul>
</details>

Any surprises there, before we move on?

## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3-5 min setup, plus 10-12 min for each of 3 partners)

### Detailed instructions for workshop-at-a-distance

1. Go to your first partner's repo on GitHub, and use the green "Code" button. If you have a fast connection and lots of disk space, you can clone (e.g. with the "Open with GitHub Desktop" option); otherwise, you might be better off using the **Download ZIP** option. <figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/github--clone-code-zip.png" alt="Code button to clone repo; also includes the URL to use with the command line." /></figure>
    - In order to avoid conflicts with your own repo, you'll want to **add your partner's name to the name of the Local Folder,** so it's not the same as yours.  <figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/github-desktop--directory-not-empty.png" alt="if you get an error, just change the folder name on the second line (local)" /></figure>

2. Open the folder. If you cloned with GitHub Desktop, choose View in Finder (Mac) / View in Explorer (PC) to find the files you just downloaded, and open them in Audacity.<figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/github-desktop--show-in-finder.png" alt="GitHub Desktop with Show in Finder button highlighted in main area and Repository menu"/></figure>

3. Optionally, zoom out to see the whole Audacity project with View > Track Size > Fit to Height / Fit to Width.  <figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/audacity--fit-to-height-and-width.png" alt="Audacity's File menu, with Track Size options highlighted" /></figure> Note that you can later use the same menu to Expand All Tracks; this will let you see the settings for pan, gain, etc.

4. Here's where the cycle really starts:
  * **describe** the soundscape and narrative you hear
  * **evaluate** the project relative to the shared set of criteria, and
  * **suggest** changes that you think would take it to baseline and/or above.

5. Finally, make sure you **post** all these comments – in language you'd be comfortable sharing publicly – on the latest commit on the project's GitHub website. Here's how and where to leave comments on GitHub: Just
  * click through to the history of commits (the clock page);
  * click on the _commit hash_, the set of random-seeming numbers and letters almost at the end of the top row (i.e., for the most recent commit); and
  * scroll to the bottom of the _diff view_ that appears. You'll see a comment box there: <figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/github--comment-on-commit.gif" alt="screencast of the three steps just described"/><figcaption>You can leave comments on a particular commit using the GitHub website. <em>GIF made with <a href="https://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>

6. Repeat the steps above for your next two partners' repos. On subsequent loops, note that **after** viewing/listening to the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous comments.

### Your Groups
<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's do this!
</div>

Within each group, **you're responsible for commenting on the three people that follow you in your line**; if that takes you to the end of the line, wrap around again. _(e.g. Abby will review soundscape narratives for Garrett, Grace D, and Greg; Garrett will review for Grace D, Greg, and Mason; Grace D will review for Greg, Mason, and Abby; and so on.)_

I think it might be best to start by downloading and listening to one repo at a time, but your mileage may vary.

Groups:

* <a href='https://github.com/aer84/soundscape2021spring'>Abby</a>, <a href='https://github.com/Gley21/soundscape2021spring'>Garrett</a>, <a href='https://github.com/gdelallo/soundscape2021spring'>Grace D</a>, <a href='https://github.com/gregsexauer/soundscape2021spring'>Greg</a>, <a href='https://github.com/anatems1/soundscape2021spring'>Mason</a>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you're participating asynchronously, please try to complete your review <strong>before class time on Thursday</strong> – or earlier, if possible – so your partners can work with your feedback in mind. If that's just not possible (and I understand how that might be the case), let me know asap and I'll make sure the others get my feedback in the meantime. Saturday morning would be the latest when it might still be helpful, so that's the official async deadline; just confirm that you've pulled the latest version whenever you start.
</div>

## EXT: Studio
If any time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions! If you have a chance to let me know in the [shared notes doc](bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes) what you're working on or what you're wondering, all the better. :¬)

## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
Based on your viewing, if you'd like to propose changes to the baseline criteria, or add new aspirational goals to consider, please comment on the [google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2021spring-notes#heading=h.tq2fxvj4mi89)!


# Homework for Next Time
* **Next class will be a soundwriters' studio**: I'll be on Zoom during class time (2:50-4:05), as usual, but I'll mostly open the breakout groups and keep track of 25-minute intervals. I'll stay in the main room to field questions or just for check-ins.
- A final-for-now draft is due at the end of Sunday, to give you time to write a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the [soundscape narrative prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape2021spring) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale, I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture. Think about projects you'd like to try for at the end of term: e.g. What further possibilities of sound might you want to explore, perhaps in connection with other people, or with other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}); there is no minimum length requirement.

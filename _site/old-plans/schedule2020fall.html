<h2 id="unit-3">Unit III: Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h2>

<p><em>In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on.

Make sure everyone has successfully activated GitHub Pages before they leave. Note that the instructions at  https://pages.github.com/ are confusing, because we *don't want to create a whole new repo.* -->

<p>For next time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do</strong> more of the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">tutorial</a>, including at least Flexbox (8) and Responsive Design (10), if you haven’t yet.</li>

<!-- * **Write** (or respond to) a pitch toward the collaborative project
-->
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compose and push</strong> a full draft of your website project no later than Tuesday morning (let’s say 10am Eastern).</li>
  <li>When it’s ready, to test that it’s fully on GitHub, <strong>clone it again to a new location</strong> on your computer: if you can successfully open your pages in a local browser from that second location, you should be good to get feedback even from an asynchronous workshop. <em>(And you should then also be good to <strong>delete that extra copy</strong>, before you get confused as to where you’re pushing from.)</em></li>

<h2 id="unit-5">Unit V: Putting it Together (Bit by Bit)<a href="https://youtu.be/rJFz-ucuTvs?t=328"><span class="hidden">*</span>*</a></h2>

<p><em>In this final unit I’ll ask you to build on what you’ve already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team that can collaborate effectively via online formats (via Zoom, Discord, Slack, what-have-you), that’s up to you! Please do let me know if you want to be in a break-out group together during class.</em></p>

<!-- <p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p> -->

<!-- In lesson plan, include this:
* Some Twine games to play (including student projects), initially presented as a reward for finishing the web project
* Some kind of reflective/generative writing
* If you're interested in Twine, skim through [the Twine 2 wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide).
  - Important note for you Twinerers: you can reverse engineer an existing Twine! Just right-click to "view source," save that page, import the html into your Twine app, and you should be able to see what it's made of. : )

<p>For next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Preparing for the final portfolio:</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read</strong> Paul Ford’s “Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes” from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). (<a href="http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684">Pitt Library link</a>)</li>
      <li>Ford writes, “I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>” <strong>Read back</strong> through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans. What things have you done this semester?</li>
      <li><strong>Choose</strong> something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Preparing one final project or revision:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a new repository<sup>*</sup> (GH, Box, or Drive) containing a task list for your project – along with proposed roles for your team members, if you have a team of more than one.
        <ul>
          <li><sup>*</sup> If you’re updating an existing project, I recommend doing this in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches">new branch</a> of the old repository, instead.</li>
          <li>Post a link to this repository on the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">Issue Queue</a>.</li>
          <li>Decide (together, if applicable) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project, and what series of stretch goals you’ll try for beyond that minimum. Push these updated goals to the repo.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

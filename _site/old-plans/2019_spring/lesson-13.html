      <h1 id="visual-unit-workshop">Visual Unit WORKSHOP</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>: a complete-as-possible draft of your visual rhetorical collages, shared where we can find it, with a</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)</li>
  <li>Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation revisited (10 min)</li>
  <li>HW Preview</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-workflow-reminder-describe---evaluate---suggest-5-min">1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</h2>

<!-- This is the same process as last time, but not everyone was doing it. Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by giving that comment. -->

<p>To help maximize what you learn both in receiving <em>and in giving</em> feedback, please work in the following three steps:</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you see, without judging whether it's good or not. What is this project? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- Help learn how the eye is drawn. Test whether the audience is getting the main point you want to get across. --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

<!-- If possible, I'd like to give back your index cards, not from the comments you *received*, but the comments you *gave*. Read them over. Are you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? Or not? If not, strive to level up today. -->

<h2 id="2-evaluation-reminder-our-criteria-5-min">2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)</h2>
<p>We set up a few <a href="http://bit.ly/miller2019spring">shared goals and constraints</a> to meet the baseline requirements. Let’s try to help everyone get at least to there!</p>

<!--
**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
* Include at least one word, with a carefully chosen font, as explained in reflection.
* Have a clear message or intervention
* Incorporate juxtaposition
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 2 GIMP tools, and write about them in the reflection
* Aim for surprise or metaphorical leap in the elements you bring together.
* Argue in reflection why you did what you did
-->

<p>I’d like to point out two things we <em>didn’t</em> say, but I think maybe were going without saying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate)</li>
  <li>Use at least one GIMP tool to edit an image (modify the image in any way)</li>
</ul>

<p>Can we confirm these, or does someone want to make a strong argument against?</p>

<h2 id="3-peer-review-workshop-3-times-10-12-min">3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</h2>

<p>Let’s do this!</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your GIMP project, and (2) <strong>label three</strong> index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
<p>Then…</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate *counter*-clockwise around the monitor-islands. Label <em>one</em> index card <strong>From: {yourname}</strong>. View / read through the project fully at least once, then
<ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see,</li> <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria,</li> and <li><strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!</li></ol>
</div>

<p>I’ll keep track of time.</p>

<p>On subsequent loops, note that <strong>after</strong> viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards.</p>

<h2 id="4-evaluation-revisited-10-min">4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)</h2>
<p>Head back to your seats and take a minute to read <strong>and photograph</strong> the notes you’ve received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I’ll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)</p>

<p>Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?</p>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for Next Time</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Next class will be a graphic designers’ studio: <strong>bring headphones for <a href="http://noisli.com">sonic isolation</a></strong>, and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your visual rhetorical collage.
    <ul>
      <li>The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/visual-rhetoric-prompt/">visual rhetorical collage prompt</a> for further details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale (again), I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture (again!). <strong>Write a short blog post</strong> thinking about possible group projects you’d like to try for the end of term.
    <ul>
      <li>What games or branching narratives come to mind as you view the class’s arguments?</li>
      <li>Or what further possibilities of graphic design might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?</li>
      <li>You can post this to the <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/10">Issue Queue</a>; there is no minimum length requirement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ext">EXT:</h2>
<p>If time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!</p>

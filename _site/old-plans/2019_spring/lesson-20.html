<p><strong>Work to bring in</strong>: a complete-as-possible draft of your website project, shared where we can find it</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the Day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)</li>
  <li>Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation revisited (10 min)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-workflow-reminder-describe---evaluate---suggest-5-min">1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest (5 min)</h2>

<!-- This is the same process as last time, and more people were doing it! Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by giving that comment. -->

<div class="alert alert-info">
Remember that providing attentive feedback not only helps your peers revise, it also helps you practice seeing as a designer.
</div>

<p>Here are those steps again for maximizing concrete, actionable feedback:</p>
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you see, without judging whether it's good or not. What is this project? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- Help learn how the eye is drawn. Test whether the audience is getting the main point you want to get across. --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, and the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and _interpret_ these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-info">
NB: Because a website has multiple pages and parts, we might want to re-think the "describe" step.

Option one: <em>think about what's emphasized by the <strong>navigation.</strong></em> Where does the site seem to want you to go? What does it want you to do there?

Option two: <em>think about what's emphasized by the <strong>home page.</strong></em> What's immediately available with no extra clicks or scrolling?
</div>

<!-- If possible, I'd like to give back your index cards, not from the comments you *received*, but the comments you *gave*. Read them over. Are you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? Or not? If not, strive to level up today. -->

<h2 id="2-evaluation-reminder-our-shared-criteria-5-min">2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)</h2>
<p>We set up a few <a href="http://bit.ly/miller2019spring#heading=h.5phhnhe6mju7">shared goals and constraints</a> to meet the baseline requirements. Let’s try to help everyone get at least to there!</p>

<p><strong>Baseline criteria</strong>
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers’ attention.</li>
  <li>Include at least {two? three?} separate navigation locations (urls, pages, html files, etc).</li>
  <li>Have a clear mode of navigation among the pages</li>
  <li>Include at least one css stylesheet.</li>
  <li>Include at least one image, with alt text</li>
  <li>Successfully display locally in a web browser</li>
  <li>Argue in reflection why you did what you did</li>
  <li>Explain at least two CSS classes</li>
</ul>

<p>And, as always,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-peer-review-workshop-3-times-10-12-min">3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</h2>

<p>Let’s do this!</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your <strong>website</strong> (ideally in Chrome or Firefox), (2) also load up your <strong>project folder</strong> in Atom (or equivalent), so we can see the code producing that website, and (3) label three <strong>index cards</strong> <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
<p>Then…</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Switch to your _mirror-image seat_ in the other monitor-island: i.e. Aliyah switch with Jenny H, Beth switch with Aba, and so on. Starting there, we'll rotate clockwise. Label <em>one</em> index card <strong>From: {yourname}</strong>. View / read through the project fully at least once, then
<ol><li><strong>Describe</strong> what you see as the focus,</li> <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria,</li> and <li><strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!</li></ol>
Use the code in Atom to help you with steps 2 and 3.
</div>

<p>I’ll keep track of time.</p>

<p>On subsequent loops, note that <strong>after</strong> viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards.</p>

<h2 id="4-evaluation-revisited-10-min">4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)</h2>
<p>Head back to your seats and take a minute to read <strong>and photograph</strong> the notes you’ve received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I’ll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)</p>

<p>Based on your viewing, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?</p>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for Next Time</h1>
<p>Tuesday’s class (March 26th) will be one more studio for this unit, so bring headphones. The final draft will be due at 11:59 pm that night, and the accompanying reflection by Thursday’s class.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to review the criteria!</p>

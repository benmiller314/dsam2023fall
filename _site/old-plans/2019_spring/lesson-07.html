      <h1 id="sound-workshop">Sound Workshop</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>: a complete-as-possible draft of your soundscape narratives</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)</li>
  <li>Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</li>
  <li>Evaluation revisited (10 min)</li>
  <li>HW Preview</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-describe---evaluate---suggest-a-workshop-workflow-5-min">1. Describe -&gt; Evaluate -&gt; Suggest: A Workshop Workflow (5 min)</h2>

<p>Today is all about getting <em>feedback</em> for your projects. What does that metaphor mean? It’s a process by which the output is picked up again as input. You’ve brought in your output so far; now you’re going to learn by getting input from your audience.</p>

<!-- A lot of peer review fails because it falls to one of two extremes: noncommittal nods, or non-stop nitpicking. Neither really takes advantage of the output we have in front of us. -->

<p>To avoid some of the pitfalls of peer review, I’m going to insist that you provide this feedback in three steps:</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol><li> First, <strong>describe</strong> what you hear, without judging whether it's good or not. What is this project? What stands out? What seems to be the focus? <!-- A lot of times as writers, even soundwriters, we don't even know if our audience is getting the main point we want to get across.  --></li>
<li>Next, <strong>evaluate</strong> according to some shared criteria, in light of the focus you perceive in the project. <!-- This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals. --></li>
<li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> some revision possibility that you think might help take the project to the next level: assume a revision is on the way. Given the goals, the focus, the criteria, what might be next? <!-- Pose this as a suggestion, not a command: and interpret these as suggestions, not commands. --></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>We’re going to be doing this all on index cards, which don’t give you a ton of space: try to focus your response on what seems most important to the piece. (I’ll ask you to photograph the cards for your records, then turn them in so I can get an overall sense of where we are as a group.)</p>

<h2 id="2-evaluation-reminder-our-criteria-5-min">2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)</h2>
<p>We set up a few <a href="http://bit.ly/miller2019spring">shared goals and constraints</a> to meet the baseline requirements. Let’s try to help everyone get at least to there!</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Have something change from the beginning to the end of the piece</li>
    <li>Play for 2-4 minutes</li>
    <li>Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file</li>
    <li>Contain at least 1 minute of original recordings by you or your classmates.</li>
    <li>Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<!-- missing from the list:
* Convey a sense of place
* Use only source material you have fair rights to use (and cite where appropriate)
-->

<p>We also have some stretch goals, or aspirations. In offering suggestions, these are some (but not the only) good targets to aim for!</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Transitions occur at meaningful points in the narrative (e.g. the music’s volume and alignment occur together)</li>
    <li>Incorporate ~mystery sound~</li>
    <li>Use Audacity’s effects menu</li>
    <li>Have more overlap (either in more places, or more tracks)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-peer-review-workshop-3-times-10-12-min">3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)</h2>

<p>Let’s do this!</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave your seat, (1) load up your Audacity project, (2) plug in your headphones, and (3) label **three** index cards <em>For: {yourname}</em>.
</div>
<p>Then…</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Rotate clockwise around the monitor-islands. Label <strong>one</strong> index card <em>From: {yourname}</em>. Listen to the project fully at least once, then (1) <strong>Describe</strong> what you hear, (2) <strong>Evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses the criteria, (3) <strong>Suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria!
</div>

<p>I’ll keep track of time.</p>

<!-- On subsequent loops, note that you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous index cards... **after** listening to the project first. -->

<h2 id="4-evaluation-revisited-10-min">4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)</h2>
<p>Head back to your seats and take a minute to read <strong>and photograph</strong> the notes you’ve received. (Make sure your photos are legible; I’ll be collecting the cards at the end of class.)</p>

<p>Based on your listening, would anyone like to propose new criteria, whether baseline or aspirational?</p>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for Next Time</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Next class will be a sound-writers’ studio:</strong> bring headphones and whatever else you need to work towards finalizing your soundscape narrative.
    <ul>
      <li>The final draft is due at the end of the day on Sunday, and a reflection by class-time on Tuesday; see the <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/soundscape-prompt/">soundscape prompt</a> for further details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale, I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture. <strong>Write a short blog post</strong> thinking about possible group projects you’d like to try for the end of term.
    <ul>
      <li>What games or branching narratives come to mind as you listen to the class’s soundscapes?</li>
      <li>Or what further possibilities of sound might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?</li>
      <li>You can post this to the <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/5">Issue Queue</a>; there is no minimum length requirement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If time remains, go ahead and get started on those revisions!</p>

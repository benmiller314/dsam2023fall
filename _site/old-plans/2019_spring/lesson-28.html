<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>: Push your final-for-now Twine</p>

<p><strong>Plan for the Day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Recover your cards</li>
  <li>OMETs (EXT: tech comfort survey)</li>
  <li>Games! <!-- option to play in parallel or in series (twitch-style) --></li>
  <li>Open discussion / sharing</li>
  <li>Now it is clear (W.S. Merwin)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-recover-your-cards">1. Recover your cards</h2>
<p>As promised, here are the notes you gave to each other in workshops across the semester: on the visual projects, on the websites, on the twines-in-progress. <!-- the soundscape cards I already gave back, to help you level up on describe/evaluate/suggest. --> Have a look through and remind yourself of where we’ve been, and what you’ve seen.</p>

<p>Later, I’d like us to have time to name some moments of interaction or sharing that stood out as moments of learning.</p>

<h2 id="2-omets-or-reflection-time">2. OMETs or reflection time</h2>
<p>About the OMETs: these have at least three audiences.</p>

<ol>
  <li>They’ll go to my program director, to help determine if I should keep teaching this course; <!-- for adjuncts, that may make the difference in whether they get renewed again at all --></li>
  <li>they’ll become part of my portfolio application for tenure, read by other faculty inside and outside my department; <!-- again: renewal. also: promotion --></li>
  <li>and, after grades are turned in, they’ll go to me, so I can use them to revise and update the course. For that purpose, I especially value the free responses. (I also added a few numerical questions that are particular to this iteration of the course.)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you haven’t yet filled out your survey, please do so!</p>

<p>I’ll leave the room for 10-15 minutes, to give you some privacy; I’ll probably go around to the tables by the elevator. Let me know if you want me to come back earlier than that.</p>

<p>EXT: I know many of you have already filled out the survey; as an alternative (or if you’re waiting for others to finish), why not head over to the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey">Tech Comfort Survey</a> and compare your answers now to the ones from January?</p>

<h2 id="3-games-">3. Games! <!-- option to play in parallel or in series (twitch-style) --></h2>

<p>I’ve now played them all, and they’re all pretty great! Here’s where to find them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--summer-nights-1">Summer Nights</a> (four-player Jailbreak). I recommend cloning.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pitt-cdm.github.io/twine--summer-night-part-2/">A Midsummer’s Night</a> (a spookier take). Playable online!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo">Finding Ben</a>. I recommend cloning.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--cats-dogs">Survival: Dog or Cat?</a>. I recommend cloning.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pitt-cdm.github.io/twine--shore-leave/">Island Survival</a>. Playable online!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--theme-park">Theme Park After Dark</a>. I recommend cloning.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert-white">
In keeping with the Twiney theme, we have a couple of paths here: we can <strong>stick together</strong> and have presentations about what's new and improved since workshop (and why), or we can go full arcade and <strong>divide up</strong> to let everyone play at their own pace. Or if there's one or two groups that wants to do the first, we could start there and then split up.
</div>

<h2 id="4-check-in-with-the-clock">4. Check in with the clock.</h2>
<p>If we have less than five minutes left, we’ll skip to the poem.
If we have more than ten minutes left, let’s share some thanks first.
If we’re in between, let’s have a quick Q&amp;A on the final reflection.</p>

<h2 id="5-departures">5. Departures</h2>

<p>If we had a final exam, it would be next Friday from 8:00-9:50am. Instead, the [final portfolio]((https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring//uploads/handout–final-portfolio-prompt.docx) is due at the end of that exam slot: Friday, April 26, at 9:50am.</p>

<p>The reflection is the main thing, so if you do make revisions, please be sure to talk about them in the reflection.</p>

<p>And if you want to turn it in earlier, that’s cool with me: more time to grade before the deadline on Wednesday May 1!</p>

# Sound Criteria and Stretch Goals

**Work to have done**:

* Work on your soundscapes, and push a _[soundscape preview](https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape2020fall)_ to GitHub: .aup file, data folder, screenshot, and text description, plus updated list of assets and an mp3 export.

**Plan for the Day**:
1. Reflective writing (5 min)
2. Refresher on soundscapes we've liked (5 min)
3. Gathering criteria (45 min)
4. Sources, assets, permissions, citations (5-10 min)
5. EXT: Studio and microconferences

<!-- Start with review of GH Desktop for pushing large folders -->
## 1. Reflective writing (5 min) <!-- we get here at 2:38 -->
<div class="alert alert-success">
In your own space – you won't have to share this unless you want to – do a little writing about your soundscape narrative in progress. What's exciting about it? What's challenging about it? What are you unsure of?
</div>

## 2. Refresher on soundscapes we've liked (5 min)
Shift now in your writing to think about the [blog posts on listening to soundscapes]({{site.github.issues_url}}/4) – or, if you haven't read through them in a while, look at them quickly now with an eye toward _what people are praising_ in the sound pieces: **what seems to make a soundscape narrative work well? Jot down some notes.**

## 3. Gathering criteria (20-25 min) <!-- Actually took more like 45! -->
Primed now by that writing and thinking, I'm going to ask you to get in groups and brainstorm in pursuit of baseline and aspirational criteria for this unit.

### 3a. Crowdsource ideas (10 min) <!-- Actually took more like 25! -->
To bring all our notes together while allowing for real-time collaboration, **use this google doc: [bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.4z2fc4kqrdln).**

<div class="alert alert-success">
Take 10 minutes in groups to make some lists: given the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape2020fall#project-1-soundscape-narrative">goals of the unit</a>, what should we set as our minimum criteria for full credit? What are some ways we might push beyond that minimum – not just in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality?

That is, <strong>I really want you to see these aspirational goals as opportunities to stretch yourselves and your skills, not just to do more of the same.</strong> Think about what would be new and potentially exciting, but not required for everyone.
</div>

### 3b. Comment and Discuss in the Doc (10 min) <!-- actually took more like 20! -->
Read through the other groups' notes, adding collegial comments in the margins to upvote or propose modifications. As you see consensus forming, propose an official version for our list of shared criteria. If debates emerge, maybe we can use mutually exclusive aspirational goals!

<div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: If you're joining us asynchronously, please also leave comments, especially with questions or suggestions. You will be held to these criteria, so make your voice heard!
</div>

## 4. Studio While I Synthesize (25 min)

I'll work solo to write up a list that reflects your consensus in the comments, while you all work solo (with groupmates on-hand for questions or other feedback) on your projects and any needed tutorials.

Like last time, please set yourself some [studio goals in the doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.vuve9r68ee71); set a timer for 20 minutes; and then write a brief exit note on what you were able to achieve / what your next steps are.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: If you're joining us asynchronously, please do add your goals and reflections to the doc whenever you're able to "do" today's lesson.
</div>


## 5. Confirming criteria (8-10 min)
Please head back up to the [criteria in the doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.4z2fc4kqrdln). Before we head into the weekend, I'd like to confirm that we're on the same page. (At least pending any new input from async participants.)


## For next time:

* **Work** to bring in a full draft: a solid attempt at a complete soundscape narrative, ideally at the target length. Rough edges are still welcome.
* **Continue** taking periodic screenshots and posting meaningful commit messages in git / GitHub Desktop.
  - Not sure when to commit? One option is to do so whenever you're about to stop working, with a note for what you'll come back to. (e.g. Did you save and commit just now? Do you want to?) Add more commits whenever you're happy with the (potentially interim) state of some new feature.
  - Remember that **you don't need to change the project filename from draft to draft.** Why duplicate or triplicate your file storage needs? Just say what's changing in your commit messages, and keep track of which draft is which that way.
* **Push** a full draft, with the same four parts as the preview *plus* a CREDITS.md file with citations for the sources you've actually used (including direct links where possible) and permissions/license to use them. (This can be the same file as your ASSETS.md, now renamed.)
  - NB: I'm only suggesting all-caps for special files readers might want to find quickly. It kind of loses the effect if everything is in caps. (Better to be all lowercase, if you have to choose.)
* **Bring** headphones

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>If you couldn't get git-lfs working</strong>, and even a zip file is too big for GitHub, <a href="http://pitt.box.com">you can use Box</a> to share your Audacity file and its associated data folder. But please still do use git to keep track of your revision choices when possible, perhaps by committing screenshots. And may I suggest adding a link to your Box folder in your GitHub repository's README.md?

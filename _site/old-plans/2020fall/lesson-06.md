# Sound Ethics, Sound Studio

**Texts to have read / listened to:** _Writer/Designer_ on ["Working with Multimodal Assets and Sources"](https://pitt.box.com/s/xovvpta4x2tq1cs9ywr61d2g1udka8m5) (Ball, Sheppard, Arola); and optionally some overviews of [CC licenses](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Howitworks_Comic1) and [Fair Use](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use).

**Work to have achieved:** a proposal for the soundscape narrative, posted to the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/5)

## Plan for the day

1. Key Concepts and Practical Takeaways (10-15 min)
2. Fair Use and Open Licensing (10-15 min)
3. Homework preview
4. Studio time

## 1. Key Concepts and Practical Takeaways (10-15 min)

In your breakout groups, work through the following questions, and be ready to discuss with the whole class if time allows. Some you should be able to go through rather quickly, others may require more discussion.

<div class="alert alert-success">Please take notes in our <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.nm2ujm22bn25">shared note doc</a> to make up for my inability to hear all the rooms at once. I'll float around as best I can, but I do love finding overlaps and tensions across groups, when possible!</div>

Call me in if you can't come to a resolution!

### Using Sources

* What's the difference between a source and an asset?
* How would you define a "credible citation" in relation to the soundscape narratives you've proposed?
* True or false: if you can find it on the internet, you can use it in your project.
* True or false: the only sources you can use in this project are those you record yourself.
* True or false: if you record your own sources, you don't have to cite them.
* True or false: if you use a source with a Creative Commons license, you don't have to cite it.
* Why are Ball, Sheppard, and Arola so insistent about folder structure and file naming conventions?
* Does my assignment of the _Writer/Designer_ chapter fulfill the criteria of fair use? Consider all four major factors.

* EXT: For each entry in your project's assets list, add Rights information as per _Writer/Designer_ page 160. (You'll need to keep updating this, of course, as you determine what assets you really want to use.)

<div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: If you're async for this lesson, please add 2-3 comments to the shared doc with questions, clarifications, or links to / quotes from relevant passages from the reading (or elsewhere). Bonus if the quotes/links are to the optional reading.
</div>

## 2. Fair Use and Open Licensing (10-15 min)

Let's talk through any questions that came up.

I especially want to make sure we're all on the same page about those True/False questions.

Has anyone tried out any of the sites linked to from our plentiful <a href="{{site.github_url}}/resources">Resources</a> page? Any recommendations, warnings, or other advice for your classmates?

Note that there are sections for both free/licensed sounds and music, and also (separately) for audio-unit-specific advice and examples.

## 3. Homework preview (5 min)

## 4. Studio time! (40-45 min)
<!-- If possible, give feedback to selected students based on posts. Some notes here:
* If you're doing a day-in-the-life or commute, the challenge is to make at least some of your sounds different from everyone else's: parts of a particular soundscape, not a generic one. Your choice of a soundtrack overlay may help here, too.
* If you're doing something where you're not sure what you'll find, consider a journalistic approach: "always roll tape" and narrate what you're doing, then add a post-hoc voiceover that tells the story of what you ultimately found
-->

<strong>Do whatever work you need to get <em>something</em> toward your project posted to your GitHub repository by Thursday:</strong> find audio sources you have permission to use, extract assets from them, record test voiceover with your phone or computer, start moving things around in Audacity, practice some more with GitHub Desktop (or command line git).

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Remember, <strong>don't use the GitHub <em>website</em> for Audacity files!</strong> It can't handle the _data folder, and you <em>must</em> include the _data folder for your project to play back.
</div>

The goal for now is to get a feel for how you work with audio, not to have a finished product. On Thursday, we'll use your experience to refine our shared baseline criteria and brainstorm some aspirational goals.

<div class="alert alert-success">
To help with goal-setting and reflection (and, again, so I can figure out where I can be most helpful), please <strong>write a brief note in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.5pk0ri1za69t">shared doc</a> about what you're planning to work on today</strong>; at the end of class, reply to your own note to say what you achieved and/or to set yourself a new goal for homework.
</div>

**Call me over if you need help** with Audacity, Git/GitHub, or determining the license on an audio source!

# Homework for next time:
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong> on your soundscape narratives, including importing at least two assets into Audacity and putting them in conversation with each other. If you have time, do more!</li>
<li><strong>Push a soundscape preview</strong> to your GitHub repository. As per the assignment prompt, this should include:
  <ul>
  <li> A layered <strong>Audacity project file (.aup)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far (need not be a complete soundscape or narrative yet).</li>
  <li>The <strong>_<span class="hidden">_</span>data folder</strong></span> associated with your Audacity file.</li>
  <li> At least one static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a></strong> (.png or .jpg) of your Audacity file in progress. (You'll use this in your final reflection, for comparison later to subsequent drafts). <!-- Note that hyperlink: you don't need to use a camera to take a picture of your computer screen, and in fact it doesn't work that well! --></li>
  <li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li>
  <li> An updated <strong>assets.md</strong> (or rename it credits.md) file, indicating what you've actually recorded or otherwise obtained. Add source documentation for any outside sources â€“ and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses or fair use rationale; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165).</li>
  <li>Finally, <strong>export a playable mp3 file</strong>, just in case something goes awry with your _<span class="hidden">_</span>data folder. NB: You can use the same name for each of your files throughout your project, and let git handle the differences.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- Be sure to talk about layers within the clips: how might you group the sounds you heard? -->

<p>Lots of great comments on the forum: about music as setting emotion, about continuity and contrast, about silence and volume. Here are my highlights:</p>

<details><summary>Soundtrack sets the emotional tone</summary>
A fun example: an anxious arrival, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEZj3YMyAk_/">remastered</a> vs <a href="https://youtu.be/7WIw4IbIwG8?t=8">original</a>
</details>
<details><summary>Continuous background conveys place and time</summary>
Think of the hubbub of conversation in the coffee shop scene, or the road noise in Breaking Bad – but think also of the abrupt cuts in the background of "Day In: Day Out," which convey a jump from one place to another.
</details>
<details><summary>Repetition is okay. Repetition with variation is even better.</summary>
One definition of narrative is the interruption of a stable context – and the consequences of that interruption. When sounds recur, it creates a stable context. So we can break it.
</details>
<details><summary>Contrasting sound draws attention</summary>
Think of dripping sinks or broken glass – in contrast to continuous drones. Think also of how, in Battlestar Galactica, the prolonged ambient sound with no contrast makes it seem like nothing is happening.
</details>
<details><summary>Layers do a lot of work</summary>
Several people pointed out the way these things work best in concert with one another: ambient sound <em>plus</em> background music <em>plus</em> incidentals are what make it <strong>immersive</strong>.</details>

<h2 id="2-audacity-demo-10-min">2. Audacity Demo (10 min)</h2>

<p>Luckily, Audacity is made for layering!</p>

<p>We’re all going to work with the same materials: a couple of spoken tracks I pulled off of C-Span and a couple of instrumental tracks I found on <a href="http://dig.ccmixter.org/">CCmixter</a>. I’ll do a quick walkthrough of some basic editing features in Audacity, then I’ll give you time to play around solo for a little bit and see what you can make, even in just a few minutes!</p>

<p>In the soundscape2020fall repository that you cloned <a href="lesson-03">last time</a>, you’ll find a folder labeled “in-class activity.” That folder contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <div class="attribution-block">Two clips from C-Span in which <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4840911/senate-leaders-speak-house-impeaches-president-trump">Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speak immediately after the House's impeachment of President Trump.</a> Used under Public Domain, in keeping with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/about/copyrightsAndLicensing/">C-Span policies</a>.

<p>I’ll play around with these first, and then it’s your turn.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
A more substantial introduction is available at the <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/audacity_tour_guide.html">Audacity Tour Guide</a>, so please review that if you find yourself stuck! (Google is also your friend, of course.)
</div>

<h3 id="import-tracks">Import. Tracks.</h3>
<p>Visual rendering of sound.</p>

<h3 id="select-tool-zoom-tool">Select tool; zoom tool.</h3>
<p>Play a loop. Zoom. Selection adjust. Add label at selection.</p>

<h3 id="time-shift-tool">Time shift tool.</h3>
<p>Split vs. split new. Mute/solo tracks.</p>

<h3 id="copypaste">Copy/Paste.</h3>
<p>Works like you’d expect it should.</p>

<h3 id="effects">Effects.</h3>
<p>There are lots. Some good ones to start with: Fade in / out; change tempo; auto duck. <!-- FOR NEXT TIME, mention that it will often make sense to [duplicate a track](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/edit_menu_copy_paste_and_duplicate.html) before applying effects, so you have the flexibility to undo or fiddle around with the settings – even after moving on to other things. --></p>

<h2 id="3-audacity-play-time-25-35-min">3. Audacity Play Time (25-35 min)</h2>

<p>Your turn! Play around with the impact of different musical selections and alignments. Try splitting the speech at the pauses to extract individual words.</p>

<p>(NB: we can have some fun with reordering the words, but please don’t push those to GitHub: we don’t need any more fake news circulating!)</p>

<p>I’ll open up the breakout rooms, so you can consult with each other in parallel. Call me if you need me! Otherwise, I’ll float.</p>

<div class="alert alert-caution">If your computer can't handle both Zoom and Audacity, it's okay (not ideal, but okay) to drop out of the call for a few minutes while you're working. But do <strong>set a timer</strong>, so you can check back in after about 20 minutes.</div>

<h2 id="4-share-and-enjoy-10-min">4. Share and Enjoy (10+ min)</h2>

<p>Let’s hear a few! Anybody have a clip they’re excited to share?</p>

<h1 id="hw-for-next-time">HW for next time:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>As predicted last class, I’m asking you to <strong>read</strong> the following advice on sound recording, <strong>listening to the embedded clips</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Fowkes, Stuart. “The Top 5 Things You Need to Make a Great Field Recording.” <em>Cities &amp; Memory: Field Recordings, Sound Map, Sound Art</em>, 13 Aug. 2014, <a href="https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/">https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/</a>.</li>
      <li>MacAdam, Alison. “6 NPR Stories That Breathe Life into Neighborhood Scenes.” <em>NPR Training</em>, 30 Oct. 2015, <a href="https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/">https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/</a>. (<strong>Note the time skips she recommends</strong>: sometimes a long clip is embedded, but not meant to be listened to in full.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After thinking about the advice, <strong>take a listening tour around your local soundscape</strong>, inside or outside or some combination. (Bring your mask where appropriate.) Take a mental note of what you hear: What are the <em>continuous</em> sounds in this space? Are they distinctive, or fairly generic? What are the <em>incidental</em> sounds that contrast with the background ambiance?</li>
  <li>Try making a few recordings of your surroundings. (The <a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2020fall/resources#audio">resources page</a> has a link to recommended smartphone apps for occasional recording.) Listen back. Do they sound like you expected? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward:</h2>
<div class="alert alert-success">
The main writing assignment for the week is to <strong>post a proposal for your soundscape narrative by next Tuesday</strong>, including a preliminary chart of sound assets you might want to include.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>The term “asset” comes from a reading assignment from the book <em>Writer/Designer</em> (Ball, Sheppard, and Arola, eds). A scan of the relevant chapter is <a title="not posted to preserve the limited distribution that helps justify my fair use claim (as does my colorless copy and the limited amount copied, relative to the book)" href="https://pitt.box.com/s/xovvpta4x2tq1cs9ywr61d2g1udka8m5 ">posted to Box</a>; <strong>please read it before writing your proposal.</strong> If you don’t have time now, it’s fine to do it over the weekend.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Optionally</em>, you can also read through a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Howitworks_Comic1">short four-page webcomic</a> explaining how Creative Commons (CC) licenses get attached to copyrightable materials, and how easily CC materials can be included and/or remixed in further creations… with, at a minimum, attribution. The subject is covered in <em>Writer/Designer</em>, but the comic is cute.</li>
      <li><em>Even more optionally</em>, you can <strong>read</strong> the Stanford Overview of Fair Use, which you can find in a series of four webpages beginning at <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/">fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/</a>. This text, despite being called an overview, is really a more in-depth understanding of fair use than the brief introduction in <em>Writer/Designer</em>. If Ball et al. struck a chord with you, here’s where to read on!</li>
    </ul>

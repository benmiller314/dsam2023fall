<h1 id="can-you-picture-it-visual-rhetorics-and-argument">Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have achieved</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A final-for-now version of your soundscape narratives</li>
  <li>Write and <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/6">post</a> reflection on same</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sound and Image (15-20 min)</li>
  <li>Brief, brief intro to GIMP</li>
  <li>Visual unit overview and assignment</li>
  <li>Examples</li>
  <li>EXT: Start HW
<!-- Have GIMP running in the BG --></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-sound-and-image">1. Sound and Image</h2>

<p>First, congratulations on finishing your first project for the class! Take a deep breath!</p>

<p>Second, I know you just finished writing up a reflection on what you did, but I’m going to ask you to write a little more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Put aside the details of your project for a moment, and think about what you’ve learned about <strong><em>sound as a composing medium</em>. What does it make possible? What does it make easy? What does it make difficult?</strong> Take a minute to gather your thoughts on the page – in your own writing space, but save this somewhere you can find again at the end of the semester.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now think about Audacity, in particular, as a tool for soundwriting. Given the possibilities and affordances of sound, how does Audacity (try to) make hard things easier? How does the software tell you what’s possible? And what tricks to navigating the software, if any, did you realize only after using it for a while?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lets-discuss">Let’s discuss</h3>
<p>And let’s also take some notes in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.cutg6kwb9zj6">shared notes doc</a>.
<!-- discuss the visual layout of Audacity, e.g. the layers; the feedback of cursor events and changing size/position; the menus --></p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: If you're participating asynchronously, please add comments to the notes in the doc. (Actually use the "add comment" feature, please, so I get an alert.) These can be questions, answers to questions, links to images or blog posts, or simply upvotes to express agreement.
</div>

<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: You can take 10 minutes here to discuss and share ideas in the google doc -->

<h2 id="2-brief-brief-intro-to-gimp">2. Brief, brief intro to GIMP</h2>
<p>For the next unit, you’ll be working on directing attention through visual means, and the software I’m asking you to use is <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">GIMP</a>: the <span title="GNU, in turn, stands for 'GNU's Not Unix.' Yyup.">GNU</span> Image Manipulation Program.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>I want to do just a quick preview today, while we’re thinking about the shape of tools – and then we’ll focus on what I’m asking you to do with them.</p>

<p>Here’s a project from last semester that I was planning to nominate for the Digital Media Showcase (which was canceled because of COVID-19):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydneymasterson/visual-argument-2020spring/master/PNGs/visual-argument-2-23.png" alt="Icons of women stand in 3 rows of 4, 5, and 8; in each row, most are solid white but 1 or 2 are transparent gray with bright pink stains between their legs. Headline reads: 'Education is a Right, Not a Luxury.' A hashtag at the bottom directs viewers to #TamponTax." longdesc="#text-from-showcase-image" />

<div id="text-from-showcase-image" class="sr-only">
<h1>Education is a right, not a luxury</h1>
1 in 5 teens have struggled to afford menstrual products and 1 in 4 have missed class due to lack of access to them. <em>Still, 34 US States tax period products as a luxury.</em>
<h2>We can't change it if we don't talk about it.</h2>
Let's destigmatize talking about women's health and end the #TamponTax together.

<p>Onscreen, it’s a flat image. But if we open it in GIMP…</p>

<h3 id="initial-questions-to-ask">Initial questions to ask:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>How is the space of the app laid out?</li>
  <li>What’s given the most prominent visual focus?</li>
  <li>What features/tools do we have quick access to?</li>
</ul>

<!-- Note that these are the exact same questions I asked of Audacity. -->
<!-- give tour: layers at bottom right, tools at upper left, tool options at lower left, undo at top right. -->
<!-- Toggle visibility. -->
<!-- Duplicate -->

<div class="alert alert-info mt-3">
There are lots of tutorials out there, including right on the GIMP website. If you ever get stuck, try their aptly named <a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-getting-unstuck.html">Chapter 4: Getting Unstuck</a>. (I've also put some other resources on the <a href="https://github.com/pages/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/resources">resources page</a>, and please feel free to suggest others as you find them!
</div>

<h2 id="3-visual-unit-overview-and-assignment">3. Visual unit overview and assignment</h2>

<p>Your second project is to <strong>make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.</strong> It’s kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to learn how to capture images and arrange them using digital tools, and</li>
  <li>to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to <em>direct attention</em> and <em>help make ideas memorable</em>.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>Let’s read through this together.</p>

<!-- Go through overview, constraints, deadlines. -->

<h2 id="4-examples">4. Examples</h2>

<p>Here are some more student examples in response to this actual assignment:</p>

  <li><a href="http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/245">Women in Tech</a>, by Nicole Dash</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also pinned some examples of the kinds of collages and collisions I’ve seen on the open web, but don’t take this as expressing some absolute sense of range:

<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: You have 15 more minutes, even after the demo! Ask students to manipulate the image they posted to the Greetings and Salutations forum post. -->

<h2 id="ext-play-with-gimp">EXT: Play with GIMP</h2>
<p>If we have extra time, why not play around with GIMP and see where it steers your attention? As an image to work with, you can do a lot worse than the image of yourself (or your pet) that you posted to the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/1">Greetings and Salutations forum</a>, way back when…</p>

## EXT: More on GIMP
I'll demo, using Beverly & Pack. "Fly Me to the Moon, by Way of a Hot Air Balloon."" 7 Sept. 2009. Flickr, https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkadog/3897126692/.

Points to hit:
* Single window mode
* Lots of selection tools
   - Quick Mask to help see what's currently selected
* Pay attention to the tiny text at the bottom
<!--* Extracting objects from background. Inverse select-->
<!--
* Layers! Of course layers
* Clone tool; tool settings window
* Scale effects. Rasters vs. vectors
-->

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>If you haven’t already, <strong>download and install</strong> <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">GIMP</a>, the GNU Image Manipulation Program</li>
  <li><strong>Read</strong> the following short lessons on graphic design, by independent designer Julie Thompson:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive and negative space</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance and hierarchy</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm and movement</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Find and either <a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> or photograph</strong> at least one example of a visual or graphic design out in “the wild” that makes some sort of claim, or argument.
    <ul>
      <li>By “design,” I mean that some person made an active choice in its arrangement. A heap of clothes on the floor may have a lot of artistic potential to a photographer, but it’s not yet <em>designed</em>.</li>
      <li>By “in the wild,” I mean that I expect you to come across some in the course of your routine travels around the web – or around your surroundings, if you’re in a place where you get out into your surroundings. That said, if you need to search more actively, so be it; for one thing, you may need to pay more attention to ads that you’ve trained yourself to ignore.</li>
      <li>By “argument,” I mean there should be an idea beyond the pure visual layout. The argument could be explicit or implicit; it could be serious or a joke. (Some claims are just <em>X is like Y</em>.) But you should be able to put it in words.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Write</strong> a short blog post, sharing your visual argument example. Examine it through the lenses from the reading of positive/negative, dominance/hierarchy, and rhythm/movement: what do those lenses help you see? Would you say this is effectively designed for making its argument? (NB: If the argument is implicit, please try to articulate what you think it’s claiming.)
    <ul>
      <li>Post this to the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues">issue queue</a>, under “Visual Arguments are Everywhere”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

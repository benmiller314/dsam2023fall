# Generating Visual Ideas

**Work to have achieved**:

* Read about graphic design principles (<a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-positive-and-negative-space">positive &amp; negative space</a>, <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-dominancehierarchy">dominance &amp; hierarchy</a>, <a href="https://www.thetypetree.com/blog/graphic-design-101-rhythm-and-movement">rhythm &amp; movement</a>)
* Find a graphic or visual design that makes a claim or argument
* Analyze the designed artifact through the lenses of graphic design principles.


**Plan for the day**:

1. Building our vocabulary (25-30 min) <!-- was 30 last time, let's see if that continues online or not -->
2. Loop writing into offline sketching (15 + 10 min)
3. GIMP Practice (20 min)
4. Concurrent GIMP Demo: foreground extraction
5. Homework for next time


## 1. Building our vocabulary (10-15 min)

We have a bunch of new terms! Let's try to annotate these – just a few key words each - so we know we're on the same page. Head on over to [bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.z55p3g78u32k) and jump down to "Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric." I'll open up the breakout rooms so you can discuss.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: To get credit for asynchronous participation, use the comments feature in the doc to add at least two links to additional examples that illustrate the principles of visual dominance, rhythm, or negative space.
</div>

* Visual Dominance <!-- What draws the eye? -->
   - Scale <!-- big -->
   - Value <!-- dark/intense -->
   - Color <!-- contrast -->
   - Style <!-- contrast -->
   - Proximity <!-- isolation -->
   - Density <!-- contrast -->
* Visual Rhythm <!-- What's it for? -->
   - Repetition <!-- establish unity -->
   - Pattern <!-- establish backdrop for contrast -->
   - Flow <!-- suggest viewing sequence; works through variation set against similarities / multiple kinds of dominance, use of line -->
* Positive and negative space <!-- breathing room, surprises -->


### EXT: Using our vocabulary (5-10 min)
If your group feels finished and others are still working, share the images you posted to the forum within your group. See if you can level up on your comfort analyzing visual design, using the terms from the reading (and now google doc).


## EXT: Clear hierarchy vs. flat hierarchy
If we all finish filling out the google doc with time to spare (by 3:05, say), I'd like to look at two examples that came in on the forum.

## 2a. Loop writing <!-- Takes 15 min -->
For this generative exercise, adapted from [one by Sondra Perl](http://bit.ly/perlfeltsense), you'll need somewhere to write and somewhere to *draw*. Printer paper would be great; a notebook is also okay; the computer's probably not. I like pencil, but your preference may vary.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>If you need to take a minute to get those supplies, please do so now.</strong></p>

<p>If you're waiting for everyone else to come back, see if you can close your eyes and listen to your breath. (If that makes you uncomfortable, though, don't do it. Just have patience, and try not to judge.)</p>
</div>

Take a few minutes to think in writing about the visual arguments you might want to make. I'll read a series of questions aloud. Repeat them silently to yourself, and when you feel yourself answering, make a list.

These lists will remain private, unless you choose to share. I won't ask for them.

1. What ideas do you want help remembering?
2. Or what do you want to persuade others of?
3. Is there something you've noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others?
4. Is there anything else you'd like to add? Something from a course? From an activity or group you participate in? Something you've been reading about? (If there's an idea you thought of working on before class, be sure to add it now.)

Take a moment now to read back over your lists. Is there something that stands out, that says, _me, pick me_? Choose one thing to work with, at least for today, and mark it in some way. Then copy it into a clean page.

With that chosen subject, write again:

4. What terms or images come to mind when you think of this subject? ... Think about categories of words: actions vs things. Descriptors.
5. Is there anything you're forgetting to add to your list? A line from a song? A color?
6. Who else might be interested in this? Who, that is, could be your audience?

See if you can summon up the whole of this idea, like it's right here in the room with you. Where does it live? Is it above you? Inside you? In the palm of your hand? Just sit with your idea for a moment, feeling where you connect to it.

## 2b. Offline sketching <!-- starts at 3:19, so just Perl stuff was 15 min -->
And now, draw. Take a piece of paper, fold it in quarters, and in each quarter sketch out some possibility, some version, of what your idea might look like.

If you can, try to make each image significantly different from each other, to give you options; you can use your lists for inspiration. If you can't think of very different ones, then work to make just _some_ change.

We'll work here for a while.

## 3. GIMP Practice (20 min)

**Option 1:** take your profile image and an alternative background you find online to put yourself in a new location. (Use Google Image search's fair-use search, found in search results under Images > Tools > Usage Rights, or see our course site's [other resources]({{site.base_path}}/resources#visuals).)

**Option 2:** take the image you found for homework and alter it (slice it into layers, modify the layers) to get a better understanding of how its parts add up to a greater whole.


## 4. Concurrent GIMP Demo: Foreground extraction (15 min)

For those who aren't sure where to start, you can follow along with me as I do some noodling around as well. I'm going to focus on a fairly common task, extracting a foreground object from its background.

Here's what I'm using:

<figure>
<img src="../assets/img/beverly-and-pack--fly-me-to-the-moon.jpg" alt="A striped hot air balloon floating in a blue sky, darker toward the top of the image. A small, nearly full moon is visible; the ground is not." />

<!--
1. Image > Canvas Size (use %)
2. Scissor tool
3. Copy + Paste -> Floating layer -> anchor as new
4. Scale layer
5. Scissor tool (again)
6. Invert selection, new layer again
7. Layer to image size
8. Select vertical rectangle; feather edges
9. Copy + Paste as pattern
-->


# Homework for next time:

* **Choose** at least one or two tutorials from [gimp.org/tutorials](https://gimp.org/tutorials), **and practice** what they teach. For beginners, GIMP Quickies and Simple Floating Logo are probably good places to start; Layer Masks is probably intermediate; and you can get quite advanced as you scroll down the page.
* **Review** the unit-assignment [goals and options](https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-2020fall#project-2-visual-argument--rhetorical-collage) for the rhetorical collage / visual argument.
* **Write** a project proposal, thinking in words about what you'd like to make:
    - What idea or argument will you try to represent? What _claim_ will you try to make – or, at least, what is the triggering idea (starting point) of that claim?
    - Include or link to a **prospective assets list**, i.e. a table of the images you think you'll need and where you might be able to source them. You can choose to include that assets list here or place it as a file in your repository, to more easily track changes.
    - **Link to your project repository,** whether on GitHub or as a shared Box folder, so it's easier to find when we get to group work.
* **Post** your proposal to the appropriate forum on the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/).

<div class="alert alert-info">
NB: For next Thursday, I'll ask you to produce a project preview, just a little something to make sure you've started. But there's also relevant reading. If you think you'll have more time to read now than next week, you can jump ahead:
</div>

* **Review** the [resources page]({{site.github_url}}/resources) with an eye toward visuals. As before, note that there are sections both for finding images and for getting help thinking visually – and, as before, feel free to suggest additional resources if you have any!
* **Read** about fonts at [https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/](https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/).
   - Optionally, **play** a font-matching game at http://www.typeconnection.com/ to get a sense of (a) what sorts of fonts are out there and (b) how designers go about pairing fonts for what Thompson (in the reading for today) called hierarchy by "style."

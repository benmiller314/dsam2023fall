# Consolidation Unit Criteria (But Mostly Studio)

**Work to have done**: respond to an updated version of the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey); read back through your old notes (in the [google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes), in your initial letter to me, in any private reflections you've saved); continue working toward consolidating and integrating what you've learned this semester.

**Plan for the day**:

1. Review goals (baseline and aspirational) for consolidation unit (10-15 min)
2. Studio (45-60 min)
3. Plan for final class (in two days!!) (5 min)

## Review goals (baseline and aspirational) for consolidation unit

Last week, I introduced this final unit by pointing to three possible paths – a revision of an existing project, a new but similar project, or a project requiring new skills – toward two core aims I had for you:

1. to integrate and consolidate the skills you've practiced across the semester
2. to assess your own skills as a digital media composer, to find ways _you_ in particular might best contribute to a collaborative digital project (perhaps in the future)

<div class="alert alert-success">Given the work you've now settled into, are there particular <strong>outcomes or features of your built projects</strong> that you want to contract yourself into, as <strong>signs that you've fulfilled those aims?</strong> Even recognizing that the different paths might require different outcomes or signs?</div>

Let's take some notes together in the [google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.pa0d4r2faa2x). What's in our shared baseline expectations of each other, at this point in the semester? What are your possible stretch goals?

<div class="alert alert-info">NB: If we want to add final reflection criteria, we could do that now, too.</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Asynchronous participants, please also weigh in!</div>


## Studio
This is where I expect we'll spend the bulk of today's synchronous time. As usual, please...

1. Write your goals [in the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.keutw5t8mf9e)
2. Save five minutes at the end to talk about prep for next class
3. Leave an exit note to report on progress and re-set goals for moving forward.

Like last time, I'll make breakout rooms for small groups, and otherwise hang out in the main room unless people need one-on-one time (when we can go to an extra room set aside for that purpose).


## Plan for final class (in two days!!)

My final agenda item for the day is to talk about our next class, because it's our last synchronous class!

One order of business: I plan to set aside some in-class time for OMETs. If you've already done them by then, you can use that as studio time.

But beyond that, I always like to have a chance to celebrate together and share the awesomeness you've all been able to achieve. So I'd like to invite everyone to share one thing, for 2-3 minutes each. That said, I also know time is short, and some people may prefer to have more focused work-time.

Let's end the class with a quick straw poll [in the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.wspdg9q6hl32): write down the letter corresponding to what you would prefer to do:

* W - work time (studio)
* S - share the awesomeness


## For next time

* Set yourself some deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the last class?   
  - Will you continue beyond that for Sunday, knowing the final portfolio is due soon (on December )?
* Document your progress as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push.
* Pending the results of the straw poll above, choose something you're proud of, something you want to include in your portfolio, to share with the rest of the class.

4. Shareback (~15 min)
5. HW Preview

Welcome back!

### 1. Five Principles, in Brief

Can I get five people to fill us in on the five "principles of new media" from the webtext I asked you to read? i.e. One person, one term.

<!-- numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability,
and transcoding -->

Let's take notes here: [http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes](bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes)

<!-- If you had to look them up, would you rather use the webtext or the pdf? Why? -->

### 2. GitHub, part 2
Last time, we saw that GitHub can host a discussion forum, so in that sense it's a community website: it makes media social.

But its core functionality is meant to solve a different media problem:

<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's quickly walk through what it looks like via the Web Interface:
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo#readme">https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo</a></strong>
</div>

<!--
1. Create a new .txt file.
2. Demo the importance of the extension by previewing what happens if it's .md?
3. Commit the new file directly to master.
    - Note that the commit message has two parts: a short label, and a bigger box. These are kind of like the subject line of an email and the email body. The first is what you'll see automatically when browsing the history; the second will require an additional click. And GitHub will let you leave the "body" blank, but you're required to have a "subject line."
4. Change the text. Ask for suggestions in the Zoom chat.
5. Create a new branch, then merge it. Why, you ask?
   It matters when you're working with others: you want to make sure you're comparing against the most up-to-date version, so you don't accidentally erase something new.
   This will become important in a minute.

### 3. Five Principles as Lenses

Time to take these abstractions and put them into practice, in two ways:

* practice using GitHub
* practice using our key terms to help us see differently

We'll be working in groups. I've used your [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm2019survey) responses to build breakout rooms where at least one person has prior GitHub experience, so I hope you'll be able to help each other where needed!

<div class="alert alert-success">
Head to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-digital-affordances#readme">https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm-digital-affordances</a></strong>, where you'll find more instructions for what to do next – starting with forking the repo. (Thanks, anchors!)

Then follow the instructions in the README file.
</div>

We'll work in Breakout Rooms for 10-15 minutes, then report back. Don't forget that you can use Zoom chat and screenshare to your advantage.

Call me if you need me! Otherwise, I'll be floating from group to group.

## HW for next time:

* **Watch** Git and GitHub for Poets, starting at least with
[the Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) and going as far as your interest and time allow.
  - I also especially recommend [1.5 / intro to the command line](https://youtu.be/oK8EvVeVltE) and [1.6 / clone, push, pull](https://youtu.be/yXT1ElMEkW8), though the latter gets a little long-winded... But then, that's what 1.5x playback is for, am I right?
* **Practice** following the steps in the video, using either a .txt file or a .md file: create a repository on GitHub, add some content to a file, commit, edit it, commit again, and view the history. Next class we can start with any questions that came up for you in the process.
   - If you've used GitHub a lot, you may want to play around with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) formatting. Do you know what happens if you embed html inside a Markdown file? Or Markdown inside an html block?
* I highly recommend you **download** the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com), available for MacOS or Windows, which (like the command line interface) has some essential features that are unavailable on the GitHub website.
* Definitely be sure to **download** a plain text editor: I recommend [Atom](http://atom.io), but if you already use Notepad++ or SublimeText or something like that, you're fine.
* *Optional, but encouraged:* **install** command-line git, probably using either GitBash (for Windows) or Homebrew (for Mac) – or see this [walkthrough of how to install git using GitHub Desktop](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-github-desktop/#:~:text=That's%20right%2C%20even%20though%20GitHub,install%20Git%20(Figure%20B). (Linux users, I assume you don't need further instructions.)
* *Optional:* Want a more hands-on guide through the full GitHub functionality? See the GitHub Learning Lab entry on our [Resources page]({{site.github_url}}/resources).

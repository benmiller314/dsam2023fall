<h1 id="writerdesigners-studio-web-unit">Writer/Designer’s studio: web unit</h1>

<p><strong>Work to have done</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As much of the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">Interneting is Hard (but it doesn’t have to be)</a> tutorial as you can – at least parts 1-6 (from “Introduction” through “CSS Selectors”) plus 8 (“Flexbox”) and 10 (“Responsive Design”) – as well as the Medium post on <a href="https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-layout-crossed-sections-fca9e956e725">Grid Layout</a> (and optionally <a href="https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f">responsive grid</a>)</li>
  <li>A website preview? Let’s talk about it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mea culpa</li>
  <li>(Slightly) New groups
    <ul>
      <li>introductions</li>
      <li>talk into the projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set goals</li>
  <li>Go forth! (Or talk to me for demo / Q&amp;A)</li>
  <li>Revisit and update your goals</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mea-culpa">Mea culpa</h2>

<p>I goofed. I told everyone in class last Thursday that a website preview was due today… but the official <a href="https://github.com/pages/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/schedule">schedule</a> said it wasn’t due until <em>next</em> class. And it looks from the <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/network">fork network</a> like some people were still working through the tutorials, and haven’t gotten to their own projects yet. Which is not your fault!</p>

<p>Out of deference to the original timing, I’m going to hold off on the criteria-generating day until Thursday, and treat today (rather than Thursday) as a full-class studio – which is where we would have been on the original calendar.</p>

<p>If you’ve already completed a preview, you’re just in that much better shape – and maybe you’ve already finished the homework for Thursday! Yay!</p>

<p>Regardless, you can use today to move your projects forward.</p>

<h2 id="slightly-new-groups">(Slightly) New groups</h2>

<p>Because a few people have already told me they’re planning to do more advanced JavaScripty / interactive things, and a few others have expressed an interest in having songs play on their sites, I’ve made a few tweaks to the breakout room assignments, so you can more easily seek and share advice within your groups.</p>

<p>The first thing to do, then, is <strong>introduce yourselves to your groupmates,</strong> and <strong>informally share the current state of your projects</strong>. Show a preview if you’ve got one, but use this as a chance to talk through your goals and game plan, otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="more-notes--possible-goals">More notes / possible goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your homepage should probably be called something like index.html (or index.md) for it to load automatically at the root directory of your website URL. If you’re getting a 404 error, that might be the reason.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Take on the lowest line-count challenge. Ask yourself:
    <ul>
      <li>does that div need to be there?</li>
      <li>could those element-based CSS rules that repeat each other be combined into a class?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Strive for semanticity. Ask yourself:
    <ul>
      <li>can you tell what’s going on just by reading the HTML file?</li>
      <li>does the HTML hard-code any display (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;center&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;b&gt;</code>) that should be in the CSS?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-goals">Set goals!</h2>

<p>What do you need to do to level up on HTML and CSS in the direction of your specific project? As usual, please write down some goals in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.7zb9mzjb0aox">google doc</a>, so I can get an overview of where everyone’s at – and so you have a marker to come back to for your reflections, later.</p>

<p>Also for my sake and yours, please <strong>be as specific as possible:</strong> e.g. rather than “working on my site,” you might say, “choosing images for photo gallery” or “building consistent grid for layout with top menu and areas for paragraphs with a featured image” etc etc.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
I'll stay in the main room, for Q&amp;A or demo purposes, but please do call me into a room if you need me!
</div>

<p>Things I expect people have questions about include: grid layout, responsive design and media queries. But you let me know and I’ll try to meet you wherever you are.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
As usual, to get credit for asynchronous participation, please add your intentions and exit notes to the google doc when you start and stop working – and aim to work for at least two 20-minute pomodoros. (In class, we had about 50 minutes of straight-up studio time.)
</div>

<p>Save about five minutes at the end to write me a brief exit note about what you’ve been working on.</p>

<h2 id="4-exit-note">4. Exit note</h2>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Before you leave, just as a way for me to check in, I'd like to hear more about what happened today: Did you decide on your navigation? Block out the html? Make some progress on a stylesheet?

<strong>Reply to your note in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2020fall-notes#heading=h.7zb9mzjb0aox">google doc</a>.</strong>
</div>

<h1 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Finish</strong> the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">tutorial</a>, if you haven’t yet – or revisit the sections that are still confusing. I especially encourage you to look at sections 12 (<a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/">Semantic HTML</a>) and 14 (<a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/web-typography/">Web Typography</a>), and if you’re having trouble with positioning even after working through Flexbox (section 8) and Grid (on Medium), try section 9 (<a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/">Advanced Positioning</a>).
    <ul>
      <li>Email me with any questions, noting that I can help fastest if you include a screenshot and a link. Better yet, <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/new/choose">create a New Issue</a>! Then my answer to you can help others, too.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Compose and push</strong> a website preview: a beginning. As detailed in the assignment, this should include:</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>A multifile <strong>project folder</strong> (probably named "docs," for ease of use with GitHub Pages), containing a combination of html and css and image assets, even if the whole thing is not yet well-developed.</li><li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your website-in-progress, as rendered in a local web browser (for comparison later to subsequent drafts). <ul><li>(Optionally, take a screenshot of your Atom project setup, too.)</li></ul></li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li><li> An updated <strong>ASSETS.md</strong> file, now with any files or fonts you've actually obtained. As you go, add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165).</li></ul>

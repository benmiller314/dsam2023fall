**Texts to have listened to:** ["Coffee Shop Conversations"](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/248), ["Day In: Day Out"](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/177), ["A Haunted Halt"](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/295), ["Expedition to Planets Unknown"](http://dmap.pitt.edu/node/178), _[Breaking Bad]({{site.github_url}}/assets/sound/bb-pilot-opening.mp3)_, _[Battlestar Galactica]({{site.github_url}}/assets/sound/bg-pilot-opening.mp3)_.

**Work to have achieved:**

* Post [on the issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/4) about what you noticed while listening
* Download or update [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)

## Plan for the day

1. Sound and space (10 min)
2. Audacity Demo (10 min)
3. Audacity Play Time (25-35 min) <!-- we got here at ~3:19: 30 minutes in. Audacity crashes and Ben flubs w/ label track -->
4. Share and Enjoy (10ish min)
5. HW Preview (5 min)
<!-- 6. Offline sketching (10 min) -- Move to lesson-05 for 2020fall -->


## 1. Sound and Space: Takeaways from listening (5 min)
<!-- Be sure to talk about layers within the clips: how might you group the sounds you heard? -->

Lots of great comments on the forum: about music as setting emotion, about continuity and contrast, about silence and volume. Here are my highlights:

<details><summary>Soundtrack sets the emotional tone</summary>
A fun example: an anxious arrival, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEZj3YMyAk_/">remastered</a> vs <a href="https://youtu.be/7WIw4IbIwG8?t=8">original</a>
</details>
<details><summary>Continuous background conveys place and time</summary>
Think of the hubbub of conversation in the coffee shop scene, or the road noise in Breaking Bad – but think also of the abrupt cuts in the background of "Day In: Day Out," which convey a jump from one place to another.
</details>
<details><summary>Repetition is okay. Repetition with variation is even better.</summary>
One definition of narrative is the interruption of a stable context – and the consequences of that interruption. When sounds recur, it creates a stable context. So we can break it.
</details>
<details><summary>Contrasting sound draws attention</summary>
Think of dripping sinks or broken glass – in contrast to continuous drones. Think also of how, in Battlestar Galactica, the prolonged ambient sound with no contrast makes it seem like nothing is happening.
</details>
<details><summary>Layers do a lot of work</summary>
Several people pointed out the way these things work best in concert with one another: ambient sound <em>plus</em> background music <em>plus</em> incidentals are what make it <strong>immersive</strong>.</details>



## 2. Audacity Demo (10 min)

Luckily, Audacity is made for layering!

We're all going to work with the same materials: a couple of spoken tracks I pulled off of C-Span and a couple of instrumental tracks I found on [CCmixter](http://dig.ccmixter.org/). I'll do a quick walkthrough of some basic editing features in Audacity, then I'll give you time to play around solo for a little bit and see what you can make, even in just a few minutes!

In the soundscape2020fall repository that you cloned [last time](lesson-03), you'll find a folder labeled "in-class activity." That folder contains:

* <div class="attribution-block">Two clips from C-Span in which <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4840911/senate-leaders-speak-house-impeaches-president-trump">Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speak immediately after the House's impeachment of President Trump.</a> Used under Public Domain, in keeping with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/about/copyrightsAndLicensing/">C-Span policies</a>. Clips extracted using Audacity and <a href="https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower">Soundflower</a> (by Matt Ingalls).</div>

I'll play around with these first, and then it's your turn.

<div class="alert alert-info">
A more substantial introduction is available at the <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/audacity_tour_guide.html">Audacity Tour Guide</a>, so please review that if you find yourself stuck! (Google is also your friend, of course.)
</div>

### Import. Tracks.
Visual rendering of sound.

### Select tool; zoom tool.
Play a loop. Zoom. Selection adjust. Add label at selection.

### Time shift tool.
Split vs. split new. Mute/solo tracks.

### Copy/Paste.
Works like you'd expect it should.

### Effects.
There are lots. Some good ones to start with: Fade in / out; change tempo; auto duck. <!-- FOR NEXT TIME, mention that it will often make sense to [duplicate a track](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/edit_menu_copy_paste_and_duplicate.html) before applying effects, so you have the flexibility to undo or fiddle around with the settings – even after moving on to other things. -->

## 3. Audacity Play Time (25-35 min)

Your turn! Play around with the impact of different musical selections and alignments. Try splitting the speech at the pauses to extract individual words.

(NB: we can have some fun with reordering the words, but please don't push those to GitHub: we don't need any more fake news circulating!)

I'll open up the breakout rooms, so you can consult with each other in parallel. Call me if you need me! Otherwise, I'll float.

<div class="alert alert-caution">If your computer can't handle both Zoom and Audacity, it's okay (not ideal, but okay) to drop out of the call for a few minutes while you're working. But do <strong>set a timer</strong>, so you can check back in after about 20 minutes.</div>


## 4. Share and Enjoy (10+ min)

Let's hear a few! Anybody have a clip they're excited to share?

## 5. HW Preview (5 min)


# HW for next time:

* As predicted last class, I'm asking you to **read** the following advice on sound recording, **listening to the embedded clips**:
  - Fowkes, Stuart. “The Top 5 Things You Need to Make a Great Field Recording.” *Cities & Memory: Field Recordings, Sound Map, Sound Art*, 13 Aug. 2014, [https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/](https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/).
  - MacAdam, Alison. “6 NPR Stories That Breathe Life into Neighborhood Scenes.” *NPR Training*, 30 Oct. 2015, [https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/](https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/). (**Note the time skips she recommends**: sometimes a long clip is embedded, but not meant to be listened to in full.)
* After thinking about the advice, **take a listening tour around your local soundscape**, inside or outside or some combination. (Bring your mask where appropriate.) Take a mental note of what you hear: What are the _continuous_ sounds in this space? Are they distinctive, or fairly generic? What are the _incidental_ sounds that contrast with the background ambiance?
* Try making a few recordings of your surroundings. (The [resources page](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2020fall/resources#audio) has a link to recommended smartphone apps for occasional recording.) Listen back. Do they sound like you expected? Why or why not?

## Looking forward:
<div class="alert alert-success">
The main writing assignment for the week is to <strong>post a proposal for your soundscape narrative by next Tuesday</strong>, including a preliminary chart of sound assets you might want to include.
</div>

* The term "asset" comes from a reading assignment from the book _Writer/Designer_ (Ball, Sheppard, and Arola, eds). A scan of the relevant chapter is <a title="not posted to preserve the limited distribution that helps justify my fair use claim (as does my colorless copy and the limited amount copied, relative to the book)" href="https://pitt.box.com/s/xovvpta4x2tq1cs9ywr61d2g1udka8m5
">posted to Box</a>; **please read it before writing your proposal.** If you don't have time now, it's fine to do it over the weekend.
   - _Optionally_, you can also read through a [short four-page webcomic](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Howitworks_Comic1) explaining how Creative Commons (CC) licenses get attached to copyrightable materials, and how easily CC materials can be included and/or remixed in further creations... with, at a minimum, attribution. The subject is covered in _Writer/Designer_, but the comic is cute.
   - _Even more optionally_, you can **read** the Stanford Overview of Fair Use, which you can find in a series of four webpages beginning at [fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/). This text, despite being called an overview, is really a more in-depth understanding of fair use than the brief introduction in _Writer/Designer_. If Ball et al. struck a chord with you, here's where to read on!

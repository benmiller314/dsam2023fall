* Gestalt principles <!-- The whole is other than the sum of its parts -->
   - Emergence <!-- we see the whole first -->
   - Reification <!-- we fill in the gaps -->
   - Multi-stability <!-- we avoid uncertainty -->
   - Invariance <!-- we recognize sameness under difference -->
   - Prägnanz and Closure <!-- we seek simplicity -->
   - Symmetry and Order <!-- symmetry takes precedence over proximity -->
   - Figure / Ground <!-- stable or unstable -->
   - Connectedness <!-- stronger relationship than similarity or proximity -->
   - Common Regions <!-- show a connection with enclosure or background shifts -->
   - Proximity <!-- whitespace forms a separation -->
   - Continuation <!-- once on a path, eyes will continue that motion -->
   - Common Fate <!-- what moves together belongs together -->
   - Similarity <!-- color > shape -->
   - Contrast <!-- creates a focal point -->
* Connecting and Separating Elements through Contrast and Similarity <!--  -->
    - mix and match along axes we can compare:
        - size
        - shape
        - color
        - value
        - texture
        - position
        - orientation
    - use contrast sparingly, to draw attention
    - but when you use it, "go big with the contrast. You don’t want viewers to wonder whether the difference is intentional."
    - 
* Space as a design element
    - establishes contrast, emphasis, and hierarchy
    - generates drama and tension
    - provides visual rest between groups of elements

<h2 id="1-css-layout-example-grid-areas">1. CSS layout example: Grid Areas</h2>

<p>In the EXT readings on CSS Grid, from over the weekend, I’d mentioned <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/learn">Grid By Example</a>, but I suspect not many people made it that far. I’d like to play around with one of the CodePens from that site (by web developer Rachel Andrew), as a way of giving you some examples of what Grid offers in terms of layout.</p>

<p>I’ll be in her <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/oXKgoQ?editors=1100">Grid by Example 11: Defining Grid Areas</a>, which is a CodePen.</p>

<!-- Points to hit:

* We can easily stretch the header or the sidebar
* grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 120px);
* grid-template-columns: 120px 1fr;
* We can make the Content area its own grid (though NB that it's helpful to exclude the title of the section, so we'd need a wrapper)
* grid-template-columns: repeat(autofit, 120px)
  grid-template-rows: minmax(120px, max-content)

<h3 id="faq-on-layout">FAQ on layout</h3>

<details><summary>When to use Grid, and when Flexbox?</summary>

<p>Generally speaking, if you only have one dimension (one row, or one column), Flexbox is your friend. To put that another way: use <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/grid-layout-flexbox-components/">Grid for layout, Flexbox for components</a>. (That link goes to a nice explanation, with examples, of when you'd want to use which.) Some things really are harder with Grid!</p>

<p>And remember that HTML is often about nesting boxes inside boxes: there's no reason you can't have a flexbox inside a gridbox.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Do we <em>have</em> to use Grid or Flexbox?</summary>

<p>Not at all! That said, I do recommend expressing widths and heights through responsive units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>vh</code>, and <code>vw</code>) or via <code>min-</code> and <code>max-</code> rules, rather than in absolute terms. As Powell explained, this means you'll get scaling effects as the viewport changes size. To get a horizontal centering effect, you can usually use <code>margin: 0 auto;</code> on any block element with a declared width, or <code>text-align: center;</code> on any inline element, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>That said, for dynamically adjusting space between elements, and especially for centering things vertically, these new layout tools are definitely your friends.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I learn Flexbox in a more bloodthirsty way?</summary>

<p>Try <a href="https://flexboxzombies.com/">Flexbox Zombies</a>, an interactive course that's currently free. In it, you imagine the flex layout as aiming a crossbow at undead monsters: you have to position the targets using CSS rules to survive. It's kind of slow-paced, but that's because it's filled with challenges for you to solve, with the idea being that typing out the rules many times will make them second-nature by the end.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="3-studio-toward-a-full-working-draft">3. Studio: toward a full working draft</h2>

<p>Keep working on your projects and/or tutorials, knowing that you have a draft due by Tuesday morning. See if you can get up to <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes#heading=h.5bpexk6at73l">baseline</a>! (In general, use the gdoc as your source for the most up-to-date baseline, since it also has clarifying commentary.)</p>

<p>I’m hoping by now you’re starting to get a feel for how to use the browser’s inspector to see what’s being rendered, and how!</p>

<p>And now you know that includes layout like grid and flex containers, too!</p>

<h3 id="set-goals">Set Goals</h3>

<p>What do you need to do to level up on HTML and CSS in the direction of your specific project? As usual, please write down some goals in the <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes">shared google doc</a>, <strong>set a goal for today</strong>: what do you need to do to level up on HTML, CSS, and resource gathering to move toward your specific project?</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Also for my sake and yours, please <strong>be as specific as possible:</strong> e.g. rather than “working on my site,” you might say, “choosing images for photo gallery” or “building grid for layout with top menu and featured image” etc etc.
</div>

<p><em>Not sure where to start?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check <a href="http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes">Web Design in 4 minutes</a> and at least add spacing and some web-ready fonts.</li>
  <li>I also have a <a href="https://pitt.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9171fa85-be27-437d-99b9-acfa00f44a4f">7-minute screencast building on the end of that Flexbox tutorial</a> with some tips on cleaning up and proofreading your code. Hopefully informative? (Apparently I bumped against the microphone toward the beginning – terribly sorry for the occasional scraping noise!)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Already feeling done?</em> Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you repeating the same CSS rule in multiple places? Instead, see if you can reuse CSS classes in multiple places, extending them where you need to.</li>
  <li>Does that div need to be there? If it’s not for layout or semantic grouping, it might not be necessary. See that screencast above for an example.</li>
  <li>Do you have style or presentation directly in the HTML? See if you can extract it out to the stylesheet.</li>
  <li>Want more relative values for things like color? See <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/">css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="go-forth-and-dont-forget-to-document-your-process">Go forth! And Don’t forget to document your process</h3>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as a project file</li>
   <li>as a screenshot, showing your process</li>
   <li>as a git commit, saying what you've just achieved</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="exit-note">Exit note</h3>

<p>Before you leave, just as a way for me to check in, I’d like to hear more about what happened today: Did you decide on your navigation? Block out the html? Make some progress on a stylesheet? Work through a tutorial or two (and which)?</p>

<p><strong>Reply to your note in the <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm2023spring-notes">google doc</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="homework-for-next-time">Homework for next time</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Continue</strong> the <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">HTML &amp; CSS tutorial</a>, adding at least Semantic HTML (12) and Web Typography (14). If you’re encountering weird layout intransigence, you may also want to try Advanced Positioning (9).
    <ul>
      <li>Remember that the main tools for layout now in use are Grid and Flex; you can probably skip the chapter on Float except for particular use-cases (e.g. text that wraps around an image).</li>
      <li><strong>Email me with any questions</strong>, noting that I can help fastest if you include screenshots and links to your site/repo. Better yet, <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2023spring/issues/new/choose">create a New Issue</a>! Then my answer to you can help others, too.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Compose and push</strong> a second website preview, now adding or updating layout. A full, workshop-ready draft of your website project is due in one week.</li>
</ul>

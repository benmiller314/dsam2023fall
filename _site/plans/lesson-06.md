# Lesson 6: Sound Criteria and Stretch Goals

**Work to have done**:

* Work on your soundscapes, and push a _soundscape preview_ to GitHub: modular .aup3 file, screenshot, and text description, plus updated list of assets and a "flattened" mp3 export.

<!--<div class="alert alert-warning">A couple of people couldn't make it today, so I'll have Zoom on.</div> -->

**Plan for the Day**:

1. About criteria and inspirations (~5 min)
2. Reflective writing (5 + 5 min)
3. Assessing / gathering criteria and inspirations (15-20 min)
4. Studio and microconferences (~35 min)
5. Confirming criteria / Homework for next time (5 min)





## 1. Criteria-Gathering Process

In a minute I'll ask you to assess the baseline and aspirational criteria for this unit. But first, let's run through the process, and hopefully clear up some general questions. Here's the plan:

<ol class="lalpha">
  <li>Introduce the existing set</li>
  <li>Define terms</li>
  <li>Review, comment, and suggest</li>
  <li>Respond to each other</li>
  <li>Synthesis during studio</li>
</ol>

### 1a. Introduce the existing set

I've posted criteria from previous semesters in our [shared google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.uprzm6xhjg36) as a starting point.

I want to have these on screen as we talk about what it means to say something is "baseline" or "aspirational" for a particular unit.

### 1b. Define terms

* **Baseline** criteria are things every project _must_ do for minimum B credit. These are about *familiarity* with the essentials of composing in this medium, and about meeting core learning outcomes for the course.

* **Aspirational** items aren't really criteria; they're inspirations toward excellence, nudges toward knowledge; they're things worth trying, in other words.
  * You can do none of these and still get a B, or even a B+ if you do the baseline stuff really well.
  * You don't have to do all of them for an A; in fact, they're allowed to be mutually exclusive. Treat the list as a _heuristic for invention_, not a pre-flight checklist.
  * You can try things and sometimes they'll muddy the waters, make a piece worse. But it's still a learning experience, and I want to reward that. Maybe it doesn't get all the way to A, but maybe A-minus.

<div class="alert alert-info">NB: All these grades I'm talking about are  <strong>provisional</strong>: you can keep learning, reflecting, and/or revising through the final portfolio (and hopefully beyond). It's the whole semester's worth of learning I'm most interested in.</div>

Questions about any of that?

## 2. Loop writing to gather ideas and energy

### 2a. Reflective writing on your own project (5 min)

<div class="alert alert-success">
In your own space – you won't have to share this unless you want to – do a little writing about your audio narrative in progress. What's exciting about it? What's challenging about it? What are you unsure of?
</div>

### 2b. Reflective writing on what makes audio narratives awesome

Shift now in your writing to think about the narratives you've heard, especially but not exclusively the ones I assigned for homework. **What seems to make an audio narrative work well?** Think not only about what makes it work _at all_, but also what stands out in your memory: what stays with you, in other words, as excellent or emulable. **Jot down some notes.**

## 3. Assessing criteria (15-20 min)

Given the goals of the unit, and given what you've just written down, what should we set as our _minimum_ criteria for full credit? What are some ways we might push _beyond_ that minimum – not just in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality?

Let's take some notes in the [shared google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.uprzm6xhjg36)!

<!-- That is, <strong>I really want you to see the aspirational ideas as a chance to stretch yourselves and your skills, not just to do more of the same.</strong> Think about what would be new and potentially exciting, but not required for everyone. -->

### 3a. Review, comment, and suggest

<div class="alert alert-success">
Working in groups, take 10 minutes to talk amongst yourselves about what's already working, what's missing, and what you'd like to move or modify – or simply clarify.

As you reach consensus in your group, <strong>add comments in the margins</strong> or <strong>use the "suggestions" feature</strong> (click the pencil icon in the top right) to propose modifications or additions. Or ask questions, if you have them!
</div>

EXT: If you finish early, move on to the next section.


### 3b. Respond to each other
Read through the other groups' notes, adding _collegial_ replies to their comments in the margins to **upvote**, **ask (or answer) questions**, and/or **propose modifications**.

Make sure to loop back to your own comments to see if you've picked up anything to respond to.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
ALT: If you're reading this asynchronously, please also leave comments, especially with questions or suggestions. You will be held to these criteria, too, so make your voice heard!

We won't finalize them until after workshop next week.
</div>

EXT: If you finish early, move on to the next section.

## 4. Studio While I Synthesize (25-35 min)

I'll work solo to write up a clean list that reflects your consensus in the comments, while you all **work solo** (with groupmates on-hand for questions or other feedback) **on your projects and any needed tutorials.** My own tutorial screencasts are below.

<div class="alert alert-success">Like last time, please set yourself some <a href="http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.61hkw0doma7w">studio goals in the doc</a>; at the end of class, I'll ask you to write a brief exit note on what you were able to achieve / what your next steps are.</div>

Don't forget to **save and commit as you go**!

And please do call me over if you have any questions your group can't help you with.



## 5. Confirming criteria (8-10 min)
Please head back up to the [criteria in the doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.a7m7rjwmokeg). Before we head into the weekend, I'd like to confirm that we're on the same page.



## For next time:

* **Work** to bring in a full draft: a solid attempt at a complete audio narrative, ideally at the target length. Rough edges are still welcome.
  - Remember that <span class="alert-warning">you don't need to change the project filename from draft to draft!</span> Why duplicate or triplicate your file storage needs? Just say what's changing in your commit messages, and keep track of which draft is which that way.

* **Continue** taking periodic screenshots and posting meaningful commit messages in git / GitHub Desktop.
  - Not sure when to commit? One option is to do so whenever you're about to stop working, with a note for what you'll come back and do next time. (e.g. Did you save and commit just now? Don't you want to?) Add more commits whenever you're happy with the (potentially interim) state of some new feature.

* By Tuesday morning (or ideally Monday night), **push a full draft**, including  your .aup3, screenshots of Audacity, and an exported .mp3, plus an updated file with citations for the sources you've actually used (with direct links where possible) and permissions/license to use them.
  - You may also want to update the project description in your README.md file... but that's not required until the end of the unit.
  - We'll be workshopping next time, so it's really important that your piece be accessible on GitHub! If you're still having trouble, or not sure it's working, please do check with me. I have [office hours]({{site.github_url}}/office) today from 2:30-3:30 -- or [email me](mailto:millerb@pitt.edu) to work out something else.

* As always during this unit, please **bring headphones** if you have them.

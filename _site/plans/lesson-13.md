# Visual Unit Workshop

**Work to have done**: a solid attempt at a complete visual argument, ideally meeting baseline criteria. Rough edges are still welcome. Reading on fonts.


**Plan for the day**:

1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)
2. Evaluation reminder: our shared criteria (5 min)
3. Peer Review Workshop (3 times 10-12 min)
4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
5. HW Preview


<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: It's a workshop day! If you have more than one visual project file in your repo, to make this process easier, you should probably indicate in your README.md file where to find the main .xcf or .psd file for your project. Take a minute to do that now, if you need to.
</div>

## 1. Workflow Reminder: Describe -> Evaluate -> Suggest (5 min)

Like last time, I'd like you to use a workflow that, first and foremost, *helps you see what's already happening.*  

To help maximize what you learn both in receiving _and in giving_ feedback, please work in the following three steps:

<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol>
   <li>First <strong>describe</strong> what you see. Where do your eyes go first? What do you think is the main point your partner wanted to get across?</li>
   <li>Then <strong>evaluate</strong> where it meets or misses our shared criteria. NB: This is still a form of description: it's not about "good" or "bad" in the abstract but about where it meets or misses the shared or stated goals.</li>
   <li>Finally, <strong>suggest</strong> ways to meet and exceed the criteria. Let's try to help everyone get at least to baseline! NB: The idea is indeed <em>suggestion</em>, not instruction: aim for a friendly tone. (And remember to also interpret these that way, whatever their tone seems to be.)</li>
</ol>
</div>

It takes practice; not all of you were really using it last time. (Most were, though! Thanks!) Please do try: it helps make your comments more concrete and actionable. It's great to like something, but if you can't say *what* you liked, the creator can't build on that knowledge as effectively... and *you* may not be learning as much as you could by naming what you value.

**A good test is whether you can tell, just from your comment, what you were reacting to.**

<!-- I have here to return to you the index cards from the audio unit – not from the comments you *received*, but the comments you *gave*. Read them over. Were you doing describe/evaluate/suggest? For example, **can you tell from the cards what you were reacting to**? If so, be proud! See if you can do it again in a new sensory mode. If not, strive to level up today: **train your attention to see, and describe, before judging.** -->


## 2. Evaluation reminder: our criteria (5 min)
Last class, we reached a strong consensus on shared goals and constraints in [our notes doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.8l9rdeqawbpw). Huzzah! <!-- Let's just look at these together briefly, to make sure there are no surprises. -->


**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention.
* Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate
* If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece
* If not using words, clarify your message and this choice in the reflection
* Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text
* Use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals (e.g. design hierarchy)
* In project history, use non-default commit messages that say what's changing (and maybe even why)
* Make sure that the image quality isn’t too pixelated

**Aspirational inspirations**
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

* Organize your files through layer labeling, layer groups, repo structure
* Use more than 3 distinct overlapping layers
* Use more than 3 tools beyond select, move, and text that are new to you
  - e.g. Collaborate with the machine by using automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)
  - e.g. Use layer masks / blend modes for non-destructive extraction, saturation, cross-fades, etc
* Use different text effects (distort text, have it follow a path, make it circular etc.)  
* Alter part of a source image by compositing it with another image to change its meaning (see, e.g. the [globe as ice cream](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2021spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781038538), [pillow as pill](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2022spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781522661), [ketchup as tomatoes](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698522176), [ocean as carpet](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698534979))
* Create your own visual assets through photography, scanned or born-digital drawing, etc
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately articulate your message/argument
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately describe your intended audience
* Try to make your design more accessible, e.g. through dyslexia-friendly fonts, color palettes designed for people with colorblindness, high contrast for people with visual impairments, etc
* Use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other (whether to reinforce a single shared focus or to add nuance / surprise down the hierarchy)
* Refer to assigned readings in explaining your design choices, e.g. Gestalt principles, font pairings, figure and ground, etc
* Implement components of the color wheel (apply color harmony rules)
* Be bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye
* Be subtle and crafty to make your work reveal itself only gradually
* Create a way to find out more information about topic of argument (e.g. QR code linking somewhere)



## 3. Peer Review Workshop (3-5 min setup, plus 10-12 min for each of 3 partners)

## Your Groups

Within each group, **you're responsible for commenting on the three people listed after your name**; if that takes you to the end of the line, wrap around. _(e.g. Jackson will review visual arguments for Mike, Diego, and Ben; Ben will review for Ariana, Jackson, and Mike; and so on.)_

<!-- NB: If one of your partners has not yet posted a draft, reclaim that time for an EXT: Studio, but try (if you can) to loop back later this week: we're trying to accommodate Flex@Pitt. -->

### Detailed instructions for workshop

1. Go to your first partner's repo on GitHub, and use the green "Code" button. If you have lots of disk space and a chance to prep **before class, you can clone** (e.g. with the "Open with GitHub Desktop" option); then, in class, you can just pull any new changes. **Otherwise, download the individual project file** to save bandwidth.
  - To download, click the filename (not the commit message) and right-click the Download button. <figure><img src="../assets/img/github--download-one-file.png" alt="individual file on github.com"/></figure>
  - NB: If you have more than one .xcf (or .psd) file, clarify in your README which one partners should use!


2. Make sure you can open the project file; I've tried to match Photoshop users with Photoshop users, since you won't be able to open .xcf files, but check just in case. If all else fails, you should at least have a flat export in .png or .jpg.
  - NB: If you need to zoom out quickly to fit the whole image, try `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`J` in GIMP, or `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`0` in Photoshop.

3. Here's where the cycle really starts:
  - _**describe** the visual argument you see._ What seems to be the top-level focus? What's next in the hierarchy? Can you say back the argument/claim/intervention? Help your partner learn how your eye is drawn.
  - **evaluate** the project relative to the shared set of criteria, and
  - **suggest** changes that you think would take it to baseline and/or above.

4. Finally, make sure you **post** all these comments – in language you'd be comfortable sharing publicly – on the latest commit on the project's GitHub website. Here's how and where to leave comments on GitHub: Just
  - click through to the history of commits (the clock page);
  - click on the _commit hash_, the set of random-seeming numbers and letters almost at the end of the top row (i.e., for the most recent commit); and
  - scroll to the bottom of the _diff view_ that appears. You'll see a comment box there: <figure role="figure"><img src="../assets/img/github--comment-on-commit.gif" alt="screencast of the three steps just described" title="GIF made with LICEcap: https://www.cockos.com/licecap/" /></figure>

5. Repeat the steps above for your next two partners' repos. On subsequent loops, note that **after** viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous comments.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's do this!
</div>



<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>If you're participating asynchronously, please try to complete your review by the end of Saturday night, so your partners can have some weekend time (when most of you said you have more time to work) with your feedback in mind. Friday would be even better.</p>

<p>If that's just not possible (and I understand how that might be the case), let me know asap and I'll make sure the others get my feedback in the meantime. Monday night is about the latest it might still be helpful, so that's the official async participation deadline; just confirm that you've pulled the latest version whenever you start.</p>
</div> -->


<!--
first rotation starts
second rotation starts
third rotation starts
-->


NB: On subsequent loops, <em>after</em> viewing the project first, you may also want to read and/or refer to the previous comments.


## 4. Evaluation revisited (10 min)
If you finish early and are waiting for your classmates, first take a minute to reread the comments you just *gave*: **can you tell from your description what the image contains / conveys, or do you assume someone else is already looking at it?**

If you're satisfied, reflect in your own notes on this process: did it help you realize anything about the criteria, or about your own project, or about digital composing more broadly? Did it raise any new questions? 

If you want to share any insights, I'd love to hear them! Since we likely don't have time to talk it through as a full group, you can add comments or suggestions (or anonymous notes) to the shared google doc.


## EXT: Studio
Use what class time remains to make a revision plan – or even begin the revision now. As in past lessons, it would help me get a sense of how things are going if you could [write your studio goals in the shared doc](https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.8rs5z3tffbf). Thanks!




# Homework for Next Time

* If you weren't able to finish responding during class, I hope you can do so asynchronously. I'm not expecting or demanding extensive notes (remember, I used to do this with index cards), so be kind to yourself as well as to your workshop partners.
  - *If you haven't received three comments by tomorrow afternoon, please email me, and I'll be your extra respondent.*
* Next class will be a graphic designers' studio: bring whatever you need to work towards finalizing your visual argument / rhetorical collage.
  - The final draft is targeted for the end of the day on the following Sunday, and due with a reflection by class-time the following on Tuesday; see the [rhetorical collage prompt](https://github.com/benmiller314/visual-argument-{{site.course.slugterm}}#deadlines-and-products) for further details.
* Even as we zoom in toward the unit finale (again!), I want to keep one eye open toward the bigger picture. **Write a short blog post** thinking about possible group projects you'd like to try for the end of term.
  - What further possibilities of graphic design might you want to explore in connection with other people, and other media?
  - You can post this to the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}); like last time, there is no minimum length requirement, but it's an opportunity to help shape the final unit to match your interests!

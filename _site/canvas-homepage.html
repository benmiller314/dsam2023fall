<h2>Welcome to <em>Composing Digital Media!</em></h2>
<p>This course (across sections) requires students to compose digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political implications of multiple writing platforms. Students will learn how to compose a range of critical media objects using web-authoring languages, text, sound, and images, primarily in open-source software. Classes focus on theories of writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, and networked distributions; critique and analysis of digital media produced by professional and amateur digital media practitioners; and analysis and revisions of digital media composed by the students themselves.</p>
<p>This section (in particular) will focus on the core concepts of <em>layers</em> and <em>versioning</em>, applying them in the context of sound editing; image editing; and web design.</p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/schedule" title="Go to course schedule on GitHub Pages">Unit I: What Makes Digital Media New?</a></h3>
<p>In the first unit, we’ll think about the affordances of digital media: that is, what’s made possible by working with bits instead of paper, even when we are still working with words? How do the answers change, or shift, as we move beyond words into aural and visual modes?</p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/schedule#unit-2" title="Jump to this unit on GitHub Pages">Unit II: Soundscapes and Soundwriting</a></h3>
<p>In this unit, you’ll arrange layers of sound to project a sense of place, and of things happening in that place. The genre of the narrative is open: it could be documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. (The title you choose will help steer listeners' expectations, and thus their perceptions.)</p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/schedule#unit-3" title="Jump to this unit  on GitHub Pages">Unit III: Visual Rhetorics and Argument</a></h3>
<p>In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. </p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/schedule#unit-4" title="Jump to this unit on GitHub Pages">Unit IV: Webslinging (HTML + CSS markup)</a></h3>
<p>In this unit, you will build a multi-page website from scratch, beginning with html and css files.</p>

<h3><a href="https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/schedule#unit-5" title="Jump to this unit on GitHub Pages">Unit V: Putting it Together (Bit by Bit)</a></h3>
<p>In this final unit I’ll ask you to build on what you’ve already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units.</p>

  [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
  specifically Steps 3, 4, and 5.

## Workshop Steps

* Open up your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Win) and create a directory for your
  course websites:
        $ mkdir Courses
* Change into that directory:
        $ cd Courses
* Clone your forked repository by running `$ git clone` followed by the SSH link from your
  forked copy of this repository
* Do lots of things to make your site; run
        $ git add FILENAMES
  replacing FILENAMES with a space-separated list of files and directories to add,
  followed by
        $ git commit -m "Descriptive message..."
  replacing `Descriptive message...` with a message describing the change to the files
  you added.
* Create [a new GitHub repo for your actual site](https://github.com/new); the name will
  determine the URL
* Remove the original remote of your forked repo
        $ git remote rm origin
* Add a new remote to your forked repo by running
        $ git remote add origin YOURURL
  replacing `YOURURL` with the SSH URL from your newly created remote
* Push your course site to make it live
        $ git push origin gh-pages
* Make more changes; commit them; then run `git push origin gh-pages` to make them live


## Using a custom domain
* Instead of using a domain name like `http://username.github.com/repo-name/`, you can use
  a custom domain or subdomain. Use your domain registrar’s control panel to set up either a
  CNAME or A Record, as
  [described here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages)
* Then, create a text file called `CNAME` containing the domain or subdomain you set up with your
  domain registrar. For example, if you set up a CNAME record for `http://course.example.com/``,
  the contents of your CNAME file will be
        course.example.com
  Add the file to your repository (`$ git add CNAME` &
  `$ git commit -m "Added CNAME file for my custom domain"`)
  Give it time; it can take several hours for nameservers to correctly route
  your domain/subdomain to GitHub.
